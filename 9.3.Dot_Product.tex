\subsection*{Introduction}

In the last section, we considered vector addition and scalar
multiplication and found that each operation had a natural geometric
interpretation.  In this section, we will introduce a means of
multiplying vectors.

\subsection*{The Dot Product}

If we have two $n$-dimensional vectors 
$\vu=\langle u_1, u_2,\ldots,u_n\rangle$ 
and 
$\vv=\langle v_1, v_2,\ldots,v_n\rangle$, we define their \emph{dot
product}\footnote{As we will see shortly, the dot product arises in physics to calculate the work done by a vector force in a given direction. It might be more natural to define the dot product in this context, but it is more convenient from a mathematical perspective to define the dot product algebraically and then view work as an application of this definition.}\index{dot product} as
$$
\vu\cdot\vv = u_1v_1+u_2v_2 + \ldots + u_nv_n.
$$
For instance, we find that
$$
\langle 3, 0, 1 \rangle\cdot\langle -2, 1, 4\rangle = 3\cdot(-2) +
0\cdot1 + 1\cdot4 = -6 + 0 + 4 = -2.
$$
Notice that the resulting quantity is a scalar.  Our work in Preview
Activity \ref{PA:9.3} examined dot products of two-dimensional
vectors.  

\input{activities/9.3.Act2}

The dot product is a natural way to define a product of two vectors.
In addition, it behaves in ways that are similar to the product of,
say, real numbers.

  \parbox{6.25 in}{
    Let $\vu$, $\vv$, and $\vw$ be vectors in $\R^n$. Then
    \ba
  \item $\vu \cdot \vv = \vv \cdot \vu$ (the dot product is
    \emph{commutative}), and
  \item if $c$ is a scalar, then $(c\vu + \vv) \cdot \vw = c(\vu \cdot
    \vw) + \vv \cdot \vw$ (the dot product is \emph{bilinear}),
    \ea
  } \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

Moreover, the dot product gives us valuable geometric information
about the vectors and their relative orientation.  For instance, let's
consider what happens when we dot a vector with itself:
$$
\vu\cdot\vu = \langle u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n \rangle \cdot \langle u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n \rangle = 
u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2 = |\vu|^2.
$$
In other words, the dot product of a vector with itself gives the
square of the length of the vector:  $\vu\cdot\vu=|\vu|^2$.  

\subsection*{The angle between vectors}

The dot product can help us understand the angle between two
vectors.  For instance, if we are given two vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$,
there are two angles that these vectors create, as depicted in Figure
\ref{F:9.3.Angle_between}. We will call $\theta$, the smaller of these
angles, the \emph{angle between these vectors}\index{vector!angle between}.  Notice that
$\theta$ lies between 0 and $\pi$.


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{minipage}{3in}
  \begin{center}
    \scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics{figures/fig_9_3_angle_1.eps}}
    \caption{The angle between vectors $\vu$ \\ and $\vv$.}
    \label{F:9.3.Angle_between}  
  \end{center}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{3in}
      \begin{center}
    \scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics{figures/fig_9_3_angle_2.eps}}
    \caption{The triangle formed by $\vu$, $\vv$, and $\vu - \vv$.}
    \label{F:9.3.Angle}
  \end{center}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To determine this angle, we may apply the Law of Cosines to the
triangle shown in Figure \ref{F:9.3.Angle}.  

Using the fact that the dot product of a vector with itself gives us
the square of its length, together with the bilinearity of the dot product, we find:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  |\vu-\vv|^2 & = & |\vu|^2 + |\vv|^2 - 2|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta \\
  (\vu-\vv)\cdot(\vu-\vv) &=&
  \vu\cdot\vu + \vv\cdot\vv - 2|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta \\
  \vu\cdot(\vu-\vv) - \vv\cdot(\vu-\vv)& = &
  \vu\cdot\vu + \vv\cdot\vv - 2|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta \\
  \vu\cdot\vu - 2\vu\cdot\vv + \vv\cdot\vv & = & 
  \vu\cdot\vu + \vv\cdot\vv - 2|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta \\
  -2\vu\cdot\vv & = & -2|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta \\
  \vu\cdot\vv & = & |\vu||\vv|\cos\theta.
\end{eqnarray*}
To summarize, we have the important relationship
\begin{equation}
  \vu\cdot\vv = u_1v_1+u_2v_2 + \ldots + u_nv_n =
  |\vu||\vv|\cos\theta.
  \label{E:9.3.dot.angle}
\end{equation}

It is sometimes useful to think of Equation~\eqref{E:9.3.dot.angle} as giving us an expression for
the angle between two vectors:
$$
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vu||\vv|}\right).
$$
The real beauty of this expression is this:  the dot product is a very
simple algebraic operation to perform yet it provides us with
important geometric information -- namely the angle between the vectors --
that would be difficult to determine otherwise.

\subsection*{The Dot Product and Orthogonality}

When the angle between two vectors is a right angle, it is frequently
the case that something important is happening.  In this case, we say the
vectors are {\em orthogonal}.  For instance, orthogonality often plays
a role in optimization problems; to determine the shortest path from a
point in $\R^3$ to a given plane, we move along a line orthogonal to
the plane.  

As Activity \ref{A:9.3.2.a} indicates, the dot product
provides a simple means to determine whether two vectors are
orthogonal to one another.  In this case,
$\vu\cdot\vv=|\vu||\vv|\cos(\pi/2) = 0$, so we make the following important observation.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
  \parbox{6.25 in}{Two vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ in $\R^n$ are
    orthogonal \index{vectors!orthogonal} to each other
    if $\vu \cdot \vv = 0$. 
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

More generally, the sign of the dot product gives us useful
information about the relative orientation of the vectors.   If we remember that 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
  $\cos\theta > 0$ & if $\theta$ is an acute angle, \\
  $\cos\theta = 0$ & if $\theta$ is a right angle, \\
  and $\cos\theta < 0$ & if $\theta$ is an obtuse angle, \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

we see that
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
  $\vu\cdot\vv > 0$ & if $\theta$ is an acute angle, \\
  $\vu\cdot\vv = 0$ & if $\theta$ is a right angle, \\
  and $\vu\cdot\vv < 0$ & if $\theta$ is an obtuse angle. \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This is illustrated in Figure 
\ref{F:9.3.Orientations}.

\subsection*{Work, Force, and Displacement}

In physics, work is a measure of the energy required to apply a force
to an object through a displacement.  For instance, Figure
\ref{F:9.3.Work} shows a force $\vF$ displacing an object from point
$A$ to point $B$.  The displacement is then represented by the
vector $\overrightarrow{AB}$.  

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_3_work_1.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A force $\vF$ displacing an object.}
  \label{F:9.3.Work}
\end{figure}

It turns out that the work required to displace the object is
$$
W = \vF\cdot\overrightarrow{AB} = |\vF||\overrightarrow{AB}|\cos\theta.
$$
This means that the work is determined only by the magnitude of the
force applied parallel to the displacement.  Consequently, if we are
given two vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$, we would like to write $\vu$ as a
sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to $\vv$ and one of which
is orthogonal to $\vv$.  We take up this task after the next activity.

\input{activities/9.3.Act1}

\subsection*{Projections}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{minipage}{3in}
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_3_projection_1.eps}
        \caption{The projection of $\vu$ onto $\vv$.}
        \label{F:9.3.Projection}
      \end{center}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{3in}
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_3_projection_2.eps}
        \caption{$\proj_{\vv} \vu$ when $\theta > \frac\pi2$.}
        \label{F:9.3.Projection2}
      \end{center}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Suppose we are given two vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ as shown in Figure
\ref{F:9.3.Projection}.  Motivated by our discussion of work, we would
like to write $\vu$ as a sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel
to $\vv$ and one of which is orthogonal.  That is, we would like to
write 
\begin{equation}
  \vu = \proj_{\vv}\vu + \proj_{\perp\vv}\vu,
  \label{E:9.3.proj}
\end{equation}
where $\proj_{\vv}\vu$ is parallel to $\vv$ and $\proj_{\perp\vv}\vu$
is orthogonal to $\vv$.  
We call the vector $\proj_{\vv}\vu$ the
{\em projection} of $\vu$ onto $\vv$\index{vector!projection}.

To find the vector $\proj_{\vv} \vu$, we will dot both sides of Equation~(\ref{E:9.3.proj}) with the vector $\vv$, to find that
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \vu\cdot\vv& = &(\proj_{\vv}\vu + \proj_{\perp\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv \\
                   &=&(\proj_{\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv +
  (\proj_{\perp\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv \\
                  &=&(\proj_{\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv.\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Notice that $(\proj_{\perp\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv = 0$ since
$\proj_{\perp\vv}\vu$ is orthogonal to $\vv$.  Also, $\proj_{\vv}\vu$
must be a scalar multiple of $\vv$ since it is parallel to $\vv$, so we
will write $\proj_{\vv}\vu = s\vv$.  It follows that
$$
  \vu\cdot\vv =(\proj_{\vv}\vu)\cdot\vv = s\vv\cdot\vv,
$$
which means that
$$
s = \frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{\vv\cdot\vv}
$$
and hence
$$
\proj_{\vv}\vu = \frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{\vv\cdot\vv}\vv =
\frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vv|^2}\vv 
$$

It is sometimes useful to write $\proj_{\vv}\vu$ as a scalar times a
unit vector in the direction of $\vv$.  We call this scalar the
{\em component of $\vu$ along $\vv$} and denote it as
$\comp_{\vv}\vu$.  We therefore have
$$
\proj_{\vv}\vu = \frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vv|^2}\vv =
\frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vv|} \frac{\vv}{|\vv|}=
\comp_{\vv}\vu \frac{\vv}{|\vv|},
$$
so that
$$
\comp_{\vv}\vu = \frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vv|}.
$$

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
  \parbox{6.25 in}{ Let $\vu$ and $\vv$ be vectors in $\R^n$. The
    component\index{vector!component in the direction of} of $\vu$ in

    \[\comp_{\vv} \vu = \frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{|\vv|},\] and the
    projection\index{vector!projection} of $\vu$ onto $\vv$ is the
    vector \[\proj_{\vv} \vu = \frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vv\cdot\vv} \vv.\]
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

Moreover, since
\[\vu = \proj_{\vv} \vu + \proj_{\perp \vv} \vu,\]
it follows that
\[\proj_{\perp \vv} \vu = \vu - \proj_{\vv} \vu.\]
This shows that once we have computed $\proj_{\vv} \vu$, we can find
$\proj_{\perp \vv} \vu$ simply by calculating the difference of two
known vectors.

\begin{summary}
\item The dot product of two vectors in $\R^n$, $\vu = \langle u_1,
  u_2, \ldots, u_n \rangle$ and $\vv = \langle v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n
  \rangle$, is the scalar
  \[
  \vu \cdot \vv = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \cdots + u_nv_n.
  \]
\item The dot product is related to the length of a vector since
  $\vu\cdot\vu = |\vu|^2$.
\item The dot product provides us with information about the angle
  between the vectors since 
  \[
  \vu\cdot\vv = |\vu| \ |\vv|\cos\theta,
  \] 
  where $\theta$ is the angle
  between $\vu$ and $\vv$. 
\item Two vectors are orthogonal if the angle between them
  is $\pi/2$. In terms of the dot product, the vectors $\vu$ and
  $\vv$ are orthogonal if and only if $\vu \cdot \vv = 0$.
\item The projection of a vector $\vu$ in $\R^n$ onto a vector $\vv$
  in $\R^n$ is the vector
  \[
  \proj_{\vv} \vu = \frac{\vu \cdot \vv}{\vv\cdot\vv} \vv.
