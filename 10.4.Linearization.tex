\subsection*{Introduction}

One of the central concepts in single variable calculus is that the
graph of a differentiable function, when viewed on a very small scale, looks like a
line.  We call this line the tangent line and measure its slope with
the derivative.  In this section, we will extend this concept to
functions of several variables.

Let's see what happens when we look
at the graph of a two-variable function on a small scale.  To begin, let's consider the function
$$ 
f(x,y) = 6 - \frac{x^2}2 - y^2,
$$
whose graph is shown in Figure \ref{F:10.4.tangent.1}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_4_tangent_1.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The graph of $f(x,y)=6-x^2/2 - y^2$.}
  \label{F:10.4.tangent.1}
\end{figure}

We choose to study the behavior of this function near the point $(x_0,
y_0) = (1,1)$.  In particular, we wish to view the graph on an
increasingly small scale around this point, as shown in the two plots in Figure
\ref{F:10.4.tangent.2}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_4_tangent_2.eps} \hspace*{20pt}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_4_tangent_3.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The graph of $f(x,y)=6-x^2/2 - y^2$.}
  \label{F:10.4.tangent.2}
\end{figure}

Just as the graph of a differentiable single-variable function looks like a line
when viewed on a small scale, we see that the graph of this particular two-variable
function looks like a plane, as seen in Figure \ref{F:10.4.tangent.4}.
In the following preview activity, we explore how to find the equation of this plane.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_4_tangent_4.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The graph of $f(x,y)=6-x^2/2 - y^2$.}
  \label{F:10.4.tangent.4}
\end{figure}

In what follows, we will also use the important fact\footnote{As we saw in Section \ref{S:9.5.Lines_Planes}, the equation
  of a plane passing through the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ may be written
  in the form $A(x-x_0) + B(y-y_0) + C(z-z_0) = 0$.  If the
  plane is not vertical, then $C\neq 0$, and we can
  rearrange this and hence write
$
    C(z-z_0) = -A(x-x_0) - B(y-y_0) 
$
and thus
\begin{align*}
    z & = z_0-\frac AC(x-x_0) - \frac BC(y-y_0) \\
      & = z_0 + a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0)
  \end{align*}
  where $a=-A/C$ and $b=-B/C$, respectively.} that the plane passing through $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ may be expressed in the form
$z = z_0 + a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0)$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.

\subsection*{The tangent plane}

%When we looked at the graph of a differentiable single-variable
%function on a small scale, we found that it looked like a line,
%which we called the tangent line.  


Before stating the formula for the equation of the tangent plane at a point for
a general function $f(x,y)$, we need to discuss a mild technical
condition.   As we have noted, when we look at the graph of a single-variable
function on a small scale near a point $x_0$, we expect to see a line;
in this case, we say that {\em $f$ is locally linear near $x_0$} since
the graph looks like a linear function locally around $x_0$.  Of
course, there are functions, such as $f(x)=|x|$, that are not locally
linear at every point.  In single-variable calculus, we learn that if the derivative of a function exists at a point, 
then the function is guaranteed to be locally linear there.

In a similar way, we say that a two-variable function {\em $f$ is
  locally linear\index{function!locally linear} near $(x_0,y_0)$} provided that the graph of $f$ looks like a
plane when viewed on a small scale near $(x_0,y_0)$.  There are, of
course, functions that are not locally linear at some points
$(x_0,y_0)$.  However, it turns out that if the first-order partial derivatives, $f_x$ and $f_y$, are continuous near
$(x_0,y_0)$, then $f$ is locally linear at $(x_0,y_0)$ and the graph
looks like a plane, which we call the tangent plane, when viewed on a
small scale.  Moreover, when a function is locally linear at a point, we will also say it is \emph{differentiable} at that point.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{If $f$ is a function of the independent variables $x$ and $y$ and both $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist and are continuous in an open disk containing 
the point $(x_0,y_0)$, then $f$ is \textbf{differentiable}\index{function!differentiable} at $(x_0,y_0)$.
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}


So, whenever a function $z = f(x,y)$ is differentiable at a point $(x_0,y_0)$, it follows that the function has a tangent plane at $(x_0,y_0)$.  Viewed up close, the tangent plane and the function are then virtually indistinguishable.  In addition, as in Preview Activity~\ref{PA:10.4}, we find the following general formula for the tangent plane.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{
  If $f(x,y)$ has continuous first-order partial derivatives, 
  then the equation of the plane
    tangent to the graph of $f$ at the point $(x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0))$ is
  \begin{equation}
    z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).
    \label{eq:10.4.tan_plane}
  \end{equation}
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

Finally, one important note about the form of the equation for the tangent plane, $z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)$.  Say, for example, that we have the particular tangent plane $z = 7 - 2(x-3) + 4(y+1)$.  Observe that we can immediately read from this form that  $f_x(3,-1) = -2$ and $f_y(3,-1) = 4$; furthermore, $f_x(3,-1)=-2$ is the slope of the trace to both $f$ and the tangent plane in the $x$-direction at $(-3,1)$.  In the same way, $f_y(3,-1) = 4$ is the slope of the trace of both $f$ and the tangent plane in the $y$-direction at $(3,-1)$.

\subsection*{Linearization}

In single variable calculus, an important use of the tangent line is
to approximate the value of a differentiable function.  Near the point $x_0$, the
tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x_0$ is close to the
graph of $f$ near $x_0$, as shown in Figure \ref{F:10.4.2d.linear}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_4_2d_linear.eps}
    \hspace*{20pt}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_4_2d_linear_gray.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The linearization of the single-variable function $f(x)$.}
  \label{F:10.4.2d.linear}
\end{figure}

In this single-variable setting, we let $L$ denote the function whose graph is the tangent line, and thus
$$
L(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0)
$$
Furthermore, observe that $f(x) \approx L(x)$ near $x_0$.  We call $L$ the
{\em linearization} of $f$.

In the same way, the tangent plane to the graph of a differentiable function $z = f(x,y)$ at a point
$(x_0,y_0)$ provides a good approximation of $f(x,y)$ near $(x_0,
y_0)$.  Here, we define the linearization, $L$, to be the two-variable function whose
graph is the tangent plane, and thus
$$
L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) +
f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).
$$
Finally, note that $f(x,y)\approx L(x,y)$ for points near $(x_0,
y_0)$. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{F:10.4.tangent.9}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_4_tangent_9.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The linearization of $f(x,y)$.}
  \label{F:10.4.tangent.9}
\end{figure}

\input{activities/10.4.Act11}

\subsection*{Differentials}

As we have seen, the linearization $L(x,y)$ enables us to estimate the value of $f(x,y)$ for points $(x,y)$ near the base point
$(x_0, y_0)$. 
Sometimes, however, we are more interested in the {\em change} in the
function $f(x,y)$ as we move from the base point $(x_0,y_0)$ to another
point $(x,y)$.  

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_4_tangent_10.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The differential $df$ measures the approximate change in
    $f(x,y)$.} 
  \label{F:10.4.differential}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{F:10.4.differential} illustrates this situation.  Suppose
we are at the point $(x_0,y_0)$, and we know the value $f(x_0,y_0)$ of $f$ at $(x_0,y_0)$.  If we consider the displacement $\langle \Delta x, \Delta
y\rangle$ to a new point $(x,y) = (x_0+\Delta x, y_0
+ \Delta y)$, we would like to know how much the function has changed.
We denote this change by $\Delta f$, where
$$
\Delta f = f(x,y) - f(x_0, y_0).
$$
A simple way to estimate the change $\Delta f$ is to approximate it by
$df$, which represents the change in the linearization $L(x,y)$ as we move from
$(x_0,y_0)$ to $(x,y)$.  This gives
\begin{align*}
  \Delta f \approx df &= L(x,y)-f(x_0, y_0)  \\
  &= [f(x_0,y_0)+ f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) +
  f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)] - f(x_0, y_0) \\
  &= f_x(x_0,y_0)\Delta x + f_y(x_0, y_0)\Delta y. 
\end{align*}
%This leaves us with $\Delta f \approx df = f_x(x_0,y_0)\Delta x +
%f_y(x_0, y_0)\Delta y$.  
For consistency, we will denote the
change in the independent variables as $dx = \Delta x$ and $dy =
\Delta y$, and thus
\begin{equation}
  \Delta f \approx df = f_x(x_0,y_0)~dx + f_y(x_0,y_0)~dy.
  \label{E:10.4.differential}
\end{equation}
Expressed equivalently in Leibniz notation, we have
\begin{equation}
  df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}~dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial
    y}~dy.
  \label{E:10.4.differential.leib}
\end{equation}


We call the quantities $dx$, $dy$, and $df$ {\em differentials}, and
we think of them as measuring small changes in the quantities $x$,
$y$, and $f$.  Equations (\ref{E:10.4.differential}) 
and (\ref{E:10.4.differential.leib}) express the
relationship between these changes.  Equation
(\ref{E:10.4.differential.leib}) resembles an important idea 
from single-variable calculus:  when $y$ depends on $x$,
it follows in the notation of differentials that 
$$
dy = y'~dx = \frac{dy}{dx}~dx.
$$

We will illustrate the use of differentials with an
example.  Suppose we have a machine that manufactures rectangles of
width $x=20$ cm and height $y=10$ cm.  However, the machine isn't
perfect, and therefore the width could be off by $dx = \Delta x = 0.2$ cm and
the height could be off by $dy = \Delta y = 0.4$ cm.  

The area of the rectangle is 
$$
A(x,y) = xy,
$$
so that the area of a perfectly manufactured rectangle is $A(20, 10) =
200$ square centimeters.  Since the machine isn't perfect, we would
like to know how much the area of a given manufactured rectangle could differ from the
perfect rectangle.  We will estimate the uncertainty in the area using
(\ref{E:10.4.differential}), and find that
$$
\Delta A \approx dA = A_x(20, 10)~dx + A_y(20,10)~dy.
$$
Since $A_x = y$ and $A_y = x$, we have
$$
\Delta A \approx dA = 10~dx + 20~dy = 10\cdot0.2 + 20\cdot0.4 = 10.
$$
That is, we estimate that the area in our rectangles could be off by
as much as 10 square centimeters.

\begin{summary}
\item A function $f$ of two independent variables is locally linear at
  a point $(x_0,y_0)$ if the graph of $f$ looks like a plane 
  as we zoom in on the graph around the point $(x_0,y_0)$.  In this
  case, the equation of the tangent plane is given by
  $$
  z = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).
  $$
\item The tangent plane $L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)$, when considered as a function, is
  called the linearization of a differentiable function $f$ at $(x_0,y_0)$ and may be used
  to estimate values of $f(x,y)$;  that is, $f(x,y) \approx L(x,y)$
  for points $(x,y)$ near $(x_0,y_0)$.
  
\item A function $f$ of two independent variables is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$ provided that both $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist and are continuous in an open disk containing 
the point $(x_0,y_0)$.

\item The differential $df$ of a function $f(x,y)$ is related to the
  differentials $dx$ and $dy$ by
  \[df = f_x(x_0,y_0) dx + f_y(x_0,y_0)dy.\] 
  We can use this relationship to
  approximate small changes in $f$ that result from small changes in
  $x$ and $y$.
