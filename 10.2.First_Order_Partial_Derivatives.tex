\subsection*{Introduction}

The derivative plays a central role in first semester  calculus
because it provides important information about a function.  Thinking
graphically, for instance, the derivative at a point tells us the
slope of the tangent line to the graph at that point.  In addition, the
derivative at a point also provides the instantaneous rate of change of
the function with respect to changes in the independent variable.

Now that we are investigating functions of two or more variables, we
can still ask how fast the function is changing, though we have to be careful about what we mean.  Thinking
graphically again, we can try to measure how steep the graph of the
function is in a particular direction.  Alternatively, we may want to know how fast a function's
output changes in response to a change in one of the inputs.
Over the next few sections, we will develop tools for addressing
issues such as these these.  Preview
Activity \ref{PA:10.2} explores some issues with what we will come to call {\em partial
  derivatives}.

\subsection*{First-Order Partial Derivatives}

In Section \ref{S:9.1.Functions}, we studied the behavior
of a function of two or more variables by considering the {\em traces}
of the function.  Recall that in one example, we considered the function
$$
f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{32},
$$
which measures the range, or horizontal distance, in feet, traveled by a
projectile launched with an initial 
speed of $x$ feet per second at an angle $y$ radians to the
horizontal.  The graph of this function is given again on the left in Figure
\ref{F:10.2.trace.y}.  Moreover, if we fix the angle $y = 0.6$, we may view the trace $f(x,0.6)$ as a
function of $x$ alone, as seen at right in Figure \ref{F:10.2.trace.y}.  

%\begin{figure}[ht]

  %      \scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics{figures/fig_9_1_range.eps}}
  %  \caption{The graph of $f(x,y) = x^2\sin(2y)/32$.}
 %   \label{F:10.2.range}
 % \end{center}
%\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_2_trace_y_a.eps}
    \hspace*{0.5in}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_2_trace_y.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The trace with $y = 0.6$.}
  \label{F:10.2.trace.y}
\end{figure}

Since the trace is a one-variable function, we may consider its
derivative just as we did in the first semester of calculus.  With
$y=0.6$, we have
$$
f(x,0.6) = \frac{\sin(1.2)}{32}x^2,
$$
and therefore
$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x,0.6)] = \frac{\sin(1.2)}{16}x.
$$
When $x=150$, this gives
$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x,0.6)]|_{x=150} = \frac{\sin(1.2)}{16}150 \approx
8.74~\mbox{feet per feet per second},
$$
which gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the right of Figure 
\ref{F:10.2.trace.y}.  Thinking of this derivative as an instantaneous
rate of change implies that if we increase the initial speed of the projectile by
one foot per second, we expect the horizontal distance traveled to
increase by approximately 8.74 feet if we hold the launch angle constant at $0.6$ radians. 

By holding $y$ fixed and differentiating with respect to $x$, we
obtain the first-order {\em partial derivative of $f$ with respect to
  $x$}.  Denoting this partial derivative as $f_x$, we have seen that
$$
f_x(150, 0.6) = \frac{d}{dx}f(x,0.6)|_{x=150} = \lim_{h\to
  0}\frac{f(150+h, 0.6) - f(150, 0.6)}{h}.
$$
More generally, we have 
$$
f_x(a,b) = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(a+h, b)-f(a,b)}{h},
$$
provided this limit exists.

In the same way, we may obtain a trace by setting, say, $x=150$ as shown
in Figure \ref{F:10.2.trace.x}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_2_trace_x_a.eps}
    \hspace*{0.5in}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_2_trace_x.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The trace with $x = 150$.}
  \label{F:10.2.trace.x}
\end{figure}
This gives
$$
f(150, y) = \frac{150^2}{32}\sin(2y),
$$
and therefore
$$
\frac{d}{dy}[f(150,y)] = \frac{150^2}{16}\cos(2y).
$$
If we evaluate this quantity at $y=0.6$, we have
$$
\frac{d}{dy}[f(150,y)]|_{y=0.6} = \frac{150^2}{16}\cos(1.2) \approx 509.5
~\mbox{feet per radian}.
$$
Once again, the derivative gives the slope of the tangent line shown
on the right in Figure \ref{F:10.2.trace.x}.  Thinking of the
derivative as an instantaneous rate of change, we expect that the
range of the projectile increases by 509.5 feet for every radian we increase the launch angle
$y$ if we keep the initial speed of the projectile constant at 150 feet per second.  

By holding $x$ fixed and differentiating with respect to $y$, we
obtain the first-order {\em partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$}.  
As before, we denote this partial derivative as $f_y$ and write
$$
f_y(150, 0.6) = \frac{d}{dy}f(150,y)|_{y=0.6} = \lim_{h\to
  0}\frac{f(150, 0.6+h) - f(150, 0.6)}{h}.
$$
As with the partial derivative with respect to $x$, we may express this quantity more generally at an arbitrary point $(a,b)$. 
To recap, we have now arrived at the formal definition of the first-order partial derivatives of a function of two variables.

    \begin{align*}

As these examples show, each partial derivative at a point arises as
the derivative of a one-variable function defined by fixing one of the
coordinates.  In addition, we may consider each partial derivative as defining a new
function of the point $(x,y)$, just as the derivative $f'(x)$ defines
a new function of $x$ in single-variable calculus.  Due to the connection between one-variable
derivatives and partial derivatives, we will often use Leibniz-style
notation to denote partial derivatives by writing
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a, b) = f_x(a,b),
\hspace*{20pt}
\mbox{and}
\hspace*{20pt}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a, b) = f_y(a,b).
$$

To calculate the partial
derivative $f_x$, we hold $y$ fixed and thus we treat $y$ as a
constant.  In Leibniz notation, observe that 
$$
\frac{\partial }{\partial x} (x) = 1
\hspace*{20pt}
\mbox{and}
\hspace*{20pt}
\frac{\partial }{\partial x}(y) = 0.
$$
To see the contrast between how we calculate single variable derivatives and partial derivatives, and the difference between the notations $\frac{d}{dx}[ \ ]$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[ \ ]$, observe that
\begin{align*}
  & \frac{d}{dx}[3x^2 - 2x + 3] = 3\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] - 2\frac{d}{dx}[x]
  + \frac{d}{dx}[3] = 3\cdot 2x - 2, \\
  \mbox{and}\hspace*{20pt} & \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[x^2y - xy + 2y] =
  y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[x^2] -
  y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[x]
  + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[2y] = y\cdot 2x - y 
\end{align*}
Thus, computing partial derivatives is straightforward:  we use the standard rules of single variable calculus, but do so while holding one (or more) of the variables constant.

\subsection*{Interpretations of First-Order Partial Derivatives}

Recall that the derivative of a single variable function has a
geometric interpretation as the slope of the line tangent to the graph
at a given point.  Similarly, we have seen that the partial
derivatives measure the slope of a line tangent to a trace of a
function of two variables as shown in Figure
\ref{F:10.2.trace.tangent}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_2_trace_tangent_y.eps}
    \hspace*{0.5in}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_10_2_trace_tangent_x.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Tangent lines to two traces of the range function.} 
  \label{F:10.2.trace.tangent}
\end{figure}

Now we consider the first-order partial derivatives in context. Recall
that the difference quotient $\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$ for a function
$f$ of a single variable $x$ at a point where $x=a$ tells us the
average rate of change of $f$ over the interval $[a,a+h]$, while the
derivative $f'(a)$ tells us the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ at
$x=a$.
We can use these same concepts to
explain the meanings of the partial derivatives in context.

\input{activities/10.2.Act11}

\subsection*{Using tables and contours to estimate partial
  derivatives} 

Remember that functions of two variables are often represented as either
a table of data or a contour plot.
In single variable calculus, we saw how we can use the difference
quotient to approximate derivatives if, instead of an algebraic
formula, we only know the value of the
function at a few points.
The same idea applies to partial derivatives.

\begin{summary}
\item If $f(x,y)$ is a function of two variables, there are two first
  order partial derivatives of $f$: the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$,
      \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y) = f_x(x,y) = \lim_{h \to 0}
      \frac{f(x+h,y) - f(x,y)}{h},\]
      and the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$,
      \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y) = f_y(x,y) = \lim_{h \to 0}
      \frac{f(x,y+h) - f(x,y)}{h},\] 
      where each partial derivative exists only at those points $(x,y)$ for which
      the limit exists.
  \item The partial derivative $f_x(a,b)$ tells us the instantaneous rate of
    change of $f$ with respect to $x$ at $(x,y) = (a,b)$ when $y$ is fixed at $b$.  Geometrically,
    the partial derivative $f_x(a,b)$ tells us the slope of the line
    tangent to the $y=b$ trace of the function $f$ at the point
    $(a,b,f(a,b))$.
  \item The partial derivative $f_y(a,b)$ tells us the instantaneous rate of
    change of $f$ with respect to $y$ at $(x,y) = (a,b)$ when $x$ is fixed at $a$.  Geometrically,
    the partial derivative $f_y(a,b)$ tells us the slope of the line
    tangent to the $x=a$ trace of the function $f$ at the point
    $(a,b,f(a,b))$.
