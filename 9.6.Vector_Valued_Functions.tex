\subsection*{Introduction}

So far, we have seen several different examples of curves in space,
including traces and contours of functions of two variables, as well
as lines in 3-space.  Recall that for a line through a fixed point
$\vr_0$ in the direction of vector $\vv$, we may express the line
parametrically through the single vector equation
$$\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv.$$
From this perspective, the vector $\vr(t)$ is a function that depends
on the parameter $t$, and the terminal points of this vector trace out
the line in space.

Like lines, other curves in space are one-dimensional objects, and
thus we aspire to similarly express the coordinates of points on a
given curve in terms of a single variable.  Vectors are a perfect
vehicle for doing so -- we can use vectors based at the origin to
identify points in space, and connect the terminal points of these
vectors to draw a curve in space.  This approach will allow us to draw
an incredible variety of graphs in 2- and 3-space, as well as to
identify and describe curves in $n$-space for any $n$.

\subsection*{Vector-Valued Functions}

Consider the curve shown in Figure \ref{F:9.6.VVF_graph}. As in
Preview Activity \ref{PA:9.6}, we can think of a point on this curve
as resulting from a vector from the origin to the point. As the point
travels along the curve, the vector changes in order to terminate at
the desired point. %An animation is provided in Figure \ref{F:9.6.VVF_animation}.
A few still pictures of this motion are shown in Figure \ref{F:9.6.VVF_graph}.

Thus, we can think of the curve as a collection of terminal points of
vectors emanating from the origin. We therefore view a point traveling
along this curve as a function of time $t$, and define a function
$\vr$ whose input is the variable $t$ and whose output is the vector
from the origin to the point on the curve at time $t$.  In so doing,
we have introduced a new type of function, one whose input is a scalar
and whose output is a vector.

The terminal points of the vector outputs of $\vr$ then trace out the
curve in space. From this perspective, the $x$, $y$, and $z$
coordinates of the point are functions of time, $t$, say
\[x = x(t), \ \ \ y = y(t), \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ \ \ z = z(t), \]
and thus we have three coordinate functions that enable us to
represent the curve. The variable $t$ is called a \emph{parameter} and
the equations $x = x(t)$, $y = y(t)$, and $z = z(t)$ are called
\emph{parametric equations} (or a \emph{parameterization of the
  curve}). The function $\vr$ whose output is the vector from the
origin to a point on the curve is defined by
\[\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle.\]
Note that the input of $\vr$ is the real-valued parameter $t$ and the
corresponding output is vector $\langle x(t), y(t), z(t)
\rangle$. Such a function is called a \emph{vector-valued function}
because each real number input generates a vector output.  More
formally, we state the following definition.

  \parbox{6.25 in}{\begin{definition} A \textbf{vector-valued
        function}\index{vector-valued function!definition} is a

      is the set of all terminal points of the output vectors with

    {\bf Parametric equations}\index{parametric equations for a

    of the form

that describe the $(x,y,z)$ coordinates of a point on a curve in $\R^3$. \\
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

Note particularly that every set of parametric equations determines a
vector-valued function of the form
\[\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle,\]
and every vector-valued function defines a set of parametric equations
for a curve.  Moreover, we can consider vector-valued functions and
parameterizations in $\R^2$, $\R^4$, or indeed a real space of any
dimension.  As a reminder, in Section~\ref{S:9.5.Lines_Planes}, we
determined the parametric equations of a line in space using a point
and a direction vector.  For a nonlinear example, the curve in Figure
\ref{F:9.6.VVF_graph} has the parametric equations
\[x(t) = \cos(t), \ \ \ y(t) = \sin(t), \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ z(t)
= \cos(t) \sin(t).\] Represented as a vector-valued function $\vr$,
the curve in Figure \ref{F:9.6.VVF_graph} is the graph of
\[\vr(t) = \langle \cos(t), \sin(t), \cos(t) \sin(t) \rangle.\]

The examples in Activity \ref{A:9.6.1} illustrate that a
parameterization allows us to look not only at the graph, but at the
direction and speed at which the graph is traversed as $t$ changes. In
the different parameterizations of the circle, we see that we can 
start at different points and move around the circle in either
direction.  The calculus of vector-valued functions -- which we will
begin to investigate in
Section~\ref{S:9.7.Vector_Valued_Functions_Derivatives} -- will enable
us to precisely quantify the direction, speed, and acceleration of a
particle moving along a curve in space.  As such, describing curves
parametrically will allow us to not only indicate the curve itself,
but also to describe how motion occurs along the curve.

%\input{activities/9.6.Act2}



Using parametric equations to define vector-valued functions in two
dimensions is much more versatile than just defining $y$ as a function
of $x$. In fact, if $y = f(x)$ is a function of $x$, then we can
parameterize the graph of $f$ by
\[\vr(t) = \langle t, f(t) \rangle,\]
and thus every single-variable function may be described
parametrically.  In addition, as we saw in Preview Activity
\ref{PA:9.6} and Activity \ref{A:9.6.1}, we can use vector-valued
functions to represent curves in the plane that do not define $y$ as a
function of $x$ (or $x$ as a function of $y$).\footnote{As an aside,
  vector-valued functions make it easy to plot the inverse of a
  one-to-one function in two dimensions. To see how, if $y = f(x)$
  defines a one-to-one function, then we can parameterize this
  function by $\vr(t) = \langle t, f(t) \rangle$. Since the inverse
  function just reverses the role of input and output, a
  parameterization for $f^{-1}$ is $\langle f(t), t \rangle$.}

\input{activities/9.6.Act3}



Recall from our earlier work that the traces and level curves of a
function are themselves curves in space.  Thus, we may determine 
parameterizations for them.  For example, if $z = f(x,y) = \cos(x^2 +
y^2)$, the $y = 1$ trace of the function is given by setting $y = 1$
and letting $x$ be parameterized by the variable $t$; then, the trace
is the curve whose parameterization is $\langle t, 1, \cos(t^2 + 1)
\rangle.$

\begin{summary}
\item A vector-valued function is a function whose input is a real
  parameter $t$ and whose output is a vector that depends on $t$. The
  graph of a vector-valued function is the set of all terminal points
  of the output vectors with their initial points at the origin.
\item Every vector-valued function provides a parameterization of a
  curve. In $\R^2$, a parameterization of a curve is a pair of
  equations $x = x(t)$ and $y = y(t)$ that describes the coordinates
  of a point $(x,y)$ on the curve in terms of a parameter $t$. In
  $\R^3$, a parameterization of a curve is a set of three equations $x
  = x(t)$, $y=y(t)$, and $z = z(t)$ that describes the coordinates of
  a point $(x,y,z)$ on the curve in terms of a parameter $t$.
  % \item If we think of the parameter in a parameterization as
  %   representing time, then a parameterization of a curve not only
  %   describes the curve, but also a direction of motion along the
  %   curve and the rate at which a point travels along the curve as a
  %   function of time.
