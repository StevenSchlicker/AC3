\subsection*{Introduction}

In this section, we will study limits of
  functions of several variables, with a focus on limits of functions
  of two variables.   In single variable calculus, we studied the notion of limit, which turned out to be a critical
concept that formed the basis for the derivative and the definite
integral. In this section we will begin to understand how the concept
of limit for functions of two variables is similar to what we
encountered for functions of a single variable.
The limit will again be the fundamental
idea in multivariable calculus, and we will use this notion of the limit
of a function of several variables to define the important concept of
differentiability later in this chapter.  We have already seen its use in the derivatives of vector-valued functions in Section~\ref{S:9.7.Vector_Valued_Functions_Derivatives}.
  
  Let's begin by reviewing what we mean by the
  limit of a function of one variable.  We say that a function $f$ has a limit $L$ as
  $x$ approaches $a$ provided that we can make the values $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we like
  by taking $x$ sufficiently close (but not equal) to $a$.  We denote this behavior by writing
  $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = L.$$

\subsection*{Limits of Functions of Two Variables}

In Preview Activity \ref{PA:10.1}, we recalled the notion of limit
from single variable calculus and saw that a similar concept applies
to functions of two variables.
Though we will focus on functions of two variables, for the sake of
discussion, all the ideas we establish here are valid for functions of
any number of variables. In a natural followup to our work in Preview Activity \ref{PA:10.1},
we now formally define what it means for a function of two variables to have a
limit at a point.

    \begin{definition} Given a function $f = f(x,y)$, we say that $f$
      {\em has limit $L$ as $(x,y)$ approaches $(a,b)$} provided that we can make
      $f(x,y)$ as close to $L$ as we like by taking $(x,y)$
      sufficiently close (but not equal) to $(a,b)$.  We write 
      $$
      \lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y) = L.
      $$
    \end{definition}
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

To investigate the limit of a single variable function, $\lim_{x\to
  a}f(x)$, we often consider the behavior of $f$ as $x$ approaches
$a$ from the right and from the left.  Similarly, we may investigate
limits of two-variable functions, $\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y)$ by
considering the behavior of $f$ as $(x,y)$ approaches $(a,b)$ from
various directions.  This situation is more complicated because there
are infinitely many ways in which $(x,y)$ may approach $(a,b)$.  In the next activity, we
see how it is important to consider a variety of those paths in investigating whether or not a limit exists.

\input{activities/10.1.Act1}

As we have seen in Activity \ref{A:10.1.1}, if we approach $(a,b)$
along two different paths and find that $f(x,y)$ has two different
limits, we can conclude that $\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y)$ does not
exist.  This is similar
to the one-variable example $f(x)=x/|x|$ as shown in
\ref{F:10.1.one.variable}; 
$\lim_{x\to0}f(x)$ does not exist because we see different limits as
$x$ approaches 0 from the left and the right.

  \end{figure}

As a general rule, we have

    If $f(x,y)$ has two different limits as $(x,y)$ approaches $(a,b)$
    along two different paths, then $\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y)$ does
    not exist.
  }
  \hspace*{3 pt}
} \vspace*{5pt}

As the next activity shows, studying the limit of a two-variable function
$f(x,y)$ by considering the behavior of $f$ along various paths can require subtle insights. 

\input{activities/10.1.Act2}

This activity shows that we need to be careful when studying the limit
of a two-variable functions by considering its behavior along
different paths.  If we find two
different paths that result in two different limits, then we may
conclude that the limit does not exist.  However, we can never
conclude that the limit of a function exists only by considering its
behavior along different paths.

Generally speaking, concluding that a limit
$\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y)$ exists requires a more careful
argument.  For example, let's consider the function
$$
f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2}
$$
and ask whether $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)$ exists.

Note that if either $x$ or $y$ is 0, then $f(x,y) = 0$. Therefore, if
$f$ has a limit at $(0,0)$, it must be 0.  We will therefore argue
that
$$
\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y) = 0,
$$
by showing that we can make $f(x,y)$ as close to $0$ as we wish by taking $(x,y)$ sufficiently close (but not equal) to $(0,0)$.  In what follows, we view $x$ and $y$ as being real numbers that are close, but not equal, to 0.

Since $0 \leq x^2$, we have 
$$
y^2 \leq x^2+y^2,
$$
which implies that
$$\frac{y^2}{x^2+y^2} \leq 1.$$
Multiplying both sides by $x^2$ and observing that $f(x,y) \ge 0$ for all $(x,y)$ gives
$$
0\leq f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2} =
x^2\left(\frac{y^2}{x^2+y^2}\right) \leq x^2.
$$
This shows that we can make $f(x,y)$ as close to $0$ as we like
by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $0$ (for this example, it turns out that we don't even need to worry about making $y$ close to 0).  Therefore,
$$
\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2} = 0.
$$

In spite of the fact that these two most recent examples 
illustrate some of the complications that arise when studying limits
of two-variable functions, many of the properties that are familiar
from our study of single variable functions hold in precisely the same
way.  For instance, 

\vspace*{5pt}

\parbox{6.25 in}{
  \textbf{Properties of Limits.} Let $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ be
  functions so that $\ds \lim_{(x,y) \to
    (a,b)} f(x,y)$ and $\ds \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} g(x,y)$ both
  exist. Then
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\ds \lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} x = a$ \ \ \ and \ \ \ $\ds \lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}
    y = b$.
\item $\ds \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} cf(x,y) = c\left(\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)}
  f(x,y)\right)$ for any scalar $c$, 
\item $\ds \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} [f(x,y)\pm g(x,y)] = \lim_{(x,y) \to
    (a,b)} f(x,y) \pm \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} g(x,y)$, 
%\item $\ds \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} [f(x,y)-g(x,y)] = \lim_{(x,y) \to
 %   (a,b)} f(x,y) - \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} g(x,y)$, 
\item $\ds \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} [f(x,y) \cdot g(x,y)] = \left(\lim_{(x,y) \to
    (a,b)} f(x,y)\right) \cdot \left(  \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} g(x,y)\right)$, 
\item $\ds \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} \frac{f(x,y)}{g(x,y)} =
  \frac{\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y)}{\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} g(x,y)}$
 \ \ \ if \ \ \ $\ds \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} g(x,y) \neq 0$. 
\end{enumerate}
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

We can use these properties and results from single variable calculus
to verify that many limits exist. For example, these properties show
that the function $f$ 
defined by 
$$
f(x,y) = 3x^2y^3 + 2xy^2 - 3x + 1
$$ 
has a limit at every point $(a,b)$ and, moreover, 
$$
\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y) = f(a,b).
$$
The reason for this is that polynomial functions of a single variable have limits at every point. 

\subsection*{Continuity}

Recall that a function $f$ of a single variable $x$ is said to be
continuous at 
$x=a$ provided that the following three conditions are satisfied: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $f(a)$ exists,
  \item $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$ exists, and 
  \item $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$.
\end{enumerate}
Using our understanding of limits of multivariable functions, we can
define continuity in the same way. 

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{
  \begin{definition} A function $f(x,y)$ 
    is \textbf{continuous}\index{continuity} at the point $(a,
    b)$ provided that
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $f$ is defined at the point $(a, b)$,
    \item $\ds \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y)$ exists, and
    \item $\ds \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y) = f(a,b)$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{definition}
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

For instance, we have seen that the function $f(x,y) = 3x^2y^3 + 2xy^2
- 3x + 1$ is continous at every point.  And just as with single variable functions, continuity has certain
properties that are based on the properties of limits. 

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{\textbf{Properties of Continuity.} Let $f$ and
  $g$ be functions of two variables that are continuous at the point $(a,b)$. Then 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $cf$ is continuous at $(a,b)$ for any scalar $c$
  \item $f+g$ is continuous at $(a,b)$
  \item $f-g$ is continuous at $(a,b)$
  \item $fg$ is continuous at $(a,b)$
  \item $\frac{f}{g}$ is continuous at $(a,b)$ if $g(a,b) \neq 0$
  \end{enumerate}
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

Using these properties, we can apply results from single variable calculus
to decide about continuity of multivariable functions. For example, the coordinate functions $f$ and $g$ defined by $f(x,y) = x$ and $g(x,y) = y$ are continuous at every point. We can then use properties of continuity listed to conclude that every polynomial function in $x$ and $y$ is continuous at every point. For example, $g(x,y)=x^2$ and $h(x,y)=y^3$ are continuous functions, so their product $f(x,y) = x^2y^3$ is a continuous multivariable function. 


\begin{summary}
\item A function $f = f(x,y)$ has a limit $L$ at a point $(a,b)$ provided that we
  can make $f(x,y)$ as close to $L$ as we like by taking $(x,y)$
  sufficiently close (but not equal) to $(a,b)$.  
\item If $(x,y)$ has two different limits as $(x,y)$ approaches
  $(a,b)$ along two different paths, we can conclude that
  $\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y)$ does not exist.
\item Properties similar to those for one-variable functions allow us
  to conclude that many limits exist and to evaluate them.
\item A function $f = f(x,y)$ is continuous at a point $(a,b)$ in its
  domain if $f$ has a limit at $(a,b)$ and 
\[f(a,b) = \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y).\]
