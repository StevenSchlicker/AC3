\subsection*{Introduction}

In single variable calculus, we learn that a differentiable function
is \emph{locally linear} \index{locally linear}. In other words, if we
zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function at a point, the
graph looks like the tangent line to the function at that point.  In
multivariable calculus, we will soon study curves in space;
differentiable curves turn out to be locally linear as well.  In
addition, as we study functions of two variables, we will see that
such a function is locally linear at a point if the surface defined by
the function looks like a plane (the tangent plane) as we zoom in on
the graph.

Consequently, it is important for us to understand both lines and
planes in space.  We begin our work by considering some familiar ideas
in $\R^2$ but from a new perspective.

\subsection*{Lines in Space}
In two-dimensional space, a non-vertical line is defined to be the set
of points satisfying the equation
\[y = mx + b,\] for some constants $m$ and $b$. The value of $m$ (the
slope) tells us how the dependent variable changes for every one unit
increase in the independent variable, while the point $(0,b)$ is the
$y$-intercept and anchors the line to a location on the
$y$-axis. Alternatively, we can think of the slope as being related to
the vector $\langle 1, m \rangle$, which tells us the direction of the
line, as shown on the left in Figure \ref{F:9.5.line}. Thus, we can
identify a line in space by fixing a point $P$ and  
a direction $\vv$, as shown on the right.

      parallel to a fixed vector $\vv$. \end{definition} } \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

The fixed vector $\vv$ in the definition is called a
\emph{direction vector}\index{line!direction vector} for the line. As
we saw in Preview Activity~\ref{PA:9.5}, to find an equation for a
line through point $P$ in the direction of vector $\vv$, observe that
any vector parallel to $\vv$ will have the form $t \vv$ for some
scalar $t$. So, any vector emanating from the point $P$ in a direction
parallel to the vector $\vv$ will be of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:9.5.lines_1}
\overrightarrow{OP} + \vv t
\end{equation}
for some scalar $t$ (where $O$ is the origin).

Figure \ref{F:9.5.Line_2D} presents three images of a line in two-space in which we can identify the vector
$\overrightarrow{OP}$ and the vector $t \vv$ as in Equation
(\ref{eq:9.5.lines_1}).  Here, $\overrightarrow{OP}$ is the fixed
vector shown in blue, while the direction vector $\vv$ is the vector
parallel to the vector shown in green (that is, the green vector
represents $t\vv$, and the line is traced out by the terminal points
of the magenta vector). In other words, the tips (terminal points) of the magenta vectors (the vectors of the form $\overrightarrow{OP} + t\vv$) trace out the line as $t$ changes. 
%\input{activities/9.5.Act1}

In particular, the terminal points of the vectors of the form in
(\ref{eq:9.5.lines_1}) define a linear function $\vr$ in space of the
following form, which is valid in any dimension.

\vspace*{5pt}

\parbox{6.25 in}{The \textbf{vector form} of a line\index{line!vector equation} through the point $P$ in the direction of the vector $\vv$ is

\end{equation}
where $\vr_0$ is the vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$ from the origin to
the point $P$. 
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

Of course, it is common to
represent lines in the plane using the slope-intercept equation $y=mx
+ b$.  The vector form of the line, described above, is an
alternative way to represent lines that has the following two
advantages.  First, in two dimensions, we are able to represent
vertical lines, whose slope $m$ is not defined, using a vertical
direction vector, such as $\vv=\langle 0, 1\rangle$.  Second, this
description of lines works in any dimension even though
there is no concept of the slope of a line in more than two dimensions.

\subsection*{The Parametric Equations of a Line}

The vector form of a line, $\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv$ in
Equation~(\ref{eq:9.5.line_vect}), describes a line as the set of
terminal points of the vectors $\vr(t)$. If we write this in terms of
components letting
\[\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle, \ \ \ \vr_0 = \langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle, \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ \vv = \langle a, b, c \rangle,\]
then we can equate the components on both sides of $\vr(t) = \vr_0 +
t\vv$ to obtain the equations
\[x(t) = x_0 + at, \ \ \ \ \ y(t) = y_0 + bt, \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ z(t) = z_0 +
ct,\] which describe the coordinates of the points on the line. The
variable $t$ represents an arbitrary scalar and is called a
\emph{parameter}.  In particular, we use the following language.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
  \parbox{6.25 in}{The \textbf{parametric equations} for a
    line\index{line!parametric equations} through the point $P = (x_0,
    y_0, z_0)$ in the direction of the vector $\vv = \langle a,b,c
    \rangle$ are
\[x(t) = x_0 + at, \ \ \ \ \ y(t) = y_0 + bt, \ \ \ \ \ z(t) = z_0 + ct.\]
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

Notice that there are many different parametric equations for the same
line.  For example, choosing another point $P$ on the line or
another direction vector $\vv$ produces another set of parametric
equations.  It is sometimes useful to think of $t$ as a time parameter
and the parametric equations as telling us where we are on the line at
each time.  In this way, the parametric equations describe a
particular walk taken along the line; there are, of course,
many possible ways to walk along a line.

\input{activities/9.5.Act3} 


% \subsection*{The Symmetric Equations of a Line}

% So far, we have seen that a line can be represented parametrically, where the parameter's value enables us to locate various points along the line as the parameter changes.  In addition, we saw in Activity~\ref{A:9.5.2} that it a given line has more than one parameterization.  Next, we observe that in certain circumstances, we can describe a line in space through a different set of equations that are independent of a parameter.

% In particular, if we assume that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonzero in the parametric equations of a given line, then we can solve each of the three equations for $t$ and obtain the \emph{symmetric equations} of the line
% %\[\frac{x-x_0}{a} = \frac{y-y_0}{b} = \frac{z-z_0}{c}.\]
% %If any one of $a$, $b$, or $c$ is 0, then the line is parallel to one of the coordinate planes. For example, if $a=0$ and $b$ and $c$ are %non-zero, then the line is in the plane $x=x_0$ and the symmetric equations for the line are
% %\[\frac{y-y_0}{b} = \frac{z-z_0}{c} \ \text{ and } x = x_0.\]

% \vspace*{5pt}
% \nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
% \parbox{6.25 in}{The \textbf{symmetric equations} for a line\index{line!symmetric equations} through the point $P = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$ in the direction of the vector $\vv = \langle a,b,c \rangle$ are
% \[\frac{x-x_0}{a} = \frac{y-y_0}{b} = \frac{z-z_0}{c},\]
% provided that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are not zero.
% } \hspace*{3 pt}}
% \vspace*{5pt}

% For example, for the line $\mathcal{L}$ in Activity~\ref{A:9.5.2}, which passes through $P_1 = (1,2,-1)$ and $P_2=(-2,1,-2)$, which has parametric equations
% $$x(t) = 1-3t, \ \ y(t) = 2-t, \ \ z(t) = -1-t,$$
% the symmetric equations are 
% $$\frac{x-1}{-3} = \frac{y-2}{-1} = \frac{z+1}{-1}.$$

\subsection*{Planes in Space}

Now that we have a way of describing lines, we would like to develop a means of describing planes in three dimensions.  We studied the coordinate planes and planes parallel to them in Section \ref{S:9.1.Functions}. Each of those planes had one of the variables $x$, $y$, or $z$ equal to a constant. We can note that any vector in a plane with $x$ constant is orthogonal to the vector $\langle 1,0,0 \rangle$, any vector in a plane with $y$ constant is orthogonal to the vector $\langle 0,1,0 \rangle$, and any vector in a plane with $z$ constant is orthogonal to the vector $\langle 0,0,1 \rangle$.  This idea works in general to define a plane. 

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
  \parbox{6.25 in}{\begin{definition} A
      \textbf{plane}\index{plane!definition} $p$ in space is the set of
      all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point
      $P_0$ perpendicular to a fixed vector $\vn$, as shown in Figure
      \ref{F:9.5.plane.normal}. \end{definition} }
  \hspace*{3 pt}} \vspace*{5pt} 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_5_plane_normal.eps}
    \caption{A point $P_0$ on a plane $p$ with a normal vector $\vn$}
    \label{F:9.5.plane.normal}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The definition allows us to find the equation of a plane. Assume that $\vn=\langle a,b,c\rangle$, $P_0 =
(x_0, y_0, z_0)$, and that $P=(x,y,z)$ is an arbitrary point on the plane.
Since the vector $\overrightarrow{PP_0}$ lies in
the plane, it must be perpendicular to $\vn$.  This means that

\begin{eqnarray*}
  0 & = & \vn\cdot\overrightarrow{PP_0}  \\
     & = & \vn\cdot \big(\langle x,y,z \rangle - \langle x_0, y_0,
    z_0\rangle\big)  \\
     &=& \vn \cdot \langle x-x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0 \rangle  \\
     &=& a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0). \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The fixed vector $\vn$ perpendicular to the plane is frequently called
a {\em normal vector} to the plane.  We may now summarize as follows.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
  \parbox{6.25 in}{The \textbf{scalar equation} of the
    plane\index{plane!scalar equation} with normal vector $\vn =
    \langle a,b,c \rangle$ containing the point $P_0 = (x_0, y_0,
    z_0)$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:9.5.plane_norm}
a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0.
\end{equation}
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

We may take this a little further and note that since
\begin{equation*}
  a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0, 
\end{equation*}
it equivalently follows that
\begin{equation*}
  ax + by + cz = ax_0+by_0+cz_0.
\end{equation*}
That is, we may write the equation of a plane as $ax+by+cz = d$ where
where $d = \vn\cdot\langle x_0,y_0,z_0\rangle$.  

For instance, if we would like to describe the plane passing through
the point $P_0=(4, -2,1)$ and perpendicular to the vector $\vn =
\langle 1, 2, 1 \rangle$, we have
$$
  \langle 1,2,1 \rangle\cdot \langle x,y,z\rangle =
  \langle 1,2,1 \rangle\cdot \langle 4,-2,1\rangle 
$$
or
$$
x + 2y + z = 1.
$$

Notice that the coefficients of $x$, $y$, and $z$ in this description
give a vector perpendicular to the plane.  For instance, if we are
presented with the plane
$$
-2x + y - 3z = 4,
$$
we know that $\vn = \langle -2, 1, -3\rangle$ is a vector
perpendicular to the plane.
  
\input{activities/9.5.Act9}

Just as two distinct points in space determine a line, three
non-collinear points in space determine a plane.  
% Alternatively, we
% know that for a line, a single point and a direction vector suffice to
% determine the line.  For a plane, we will see that a single point and
% a \emph{normal vector} (that is, a vector perpendicular to the plane)
% will fully characterize the plane.
Consider three points $P_0$, $P_1$, and $P_2$ in space, not all lying
on the same line as shown in Figure \ref{F:9.5.Plane}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}

\caption{A plane determined by three points $P_0$, $P_1$, and $P_2$}
\label{F:9.5.Plane}
\end{figure}
% We would like to find an equation of the plane $p$ that contains these
% points, and thus describes the set of all points on the plane.

Observe that the vectors $\overrightarrow{P_0P_1}$ and
$\overrightarrow{P_0P_2}$ both lie in the plane $p$.  
If we form their cross-product
$$\vn = \overrightarrow{P_0P_1} \times \overrightarrow{P_0P_2},$$
we obtain a normal vector to the plane $p$.  
Therefore, if $P$ is any other point on  $p$, it then follows that
$\overrightarrow{P_0P}$ will be perpendicular to $\vn$, and we have,
as before, the equation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:9.5.plane_vect}
\vn \cdot \overrightarrow{P_0P} = 0.
\end{equation}

%\input{activities/9.5.Act6}
% Equation (\ref{eq:9.5.plane_vect}) is the \emph{vector form}\index{plane!vector form} of the equation of a plane, and further helps us to naturally characterize a plane. 
% This equation also tells us that a plane is the set of terminal points of vectors from a fixed point that are perpendicular to the vector $\vn$ in \ref{eq:9.5.plane_vect}.

% The fixed vector in the definition of a plane is called a \emph{normal vector}\index{plane!normal vector} to the plane; in Equation~(\ref{eq:9.5.plane_vect}), the vector $\vn$ is a normal vector.  If we let $P_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and $\vn = \langle a, b, c \rangle$ be given, and let $P = (x,y,z)$ be an arbitrary point in the plane, then Equation~(\ref{eq:9.5.plane_vect}) tells us that
% $$
% \langle x-x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0 \rangle \cdot \langle a,b,c \rangle = 0.
% $$
% When we expand the dot product in this most recent equation, we get an important standard form of the equation of a plane.

%We can use what we know about vectors and projections to find the distance from a point to a plane.

\begin{summary}
\item While lines in $\R^3$ do not have a slope, like lines in $\R^2$ they can be characterized by a point and a direction vector.  Indeed, we define a line in space to be the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point that are parallel to a fixed vector.
\item Vectors play a critical role in representing the equation of a line.  In particular, the terminal points of the vector $\vr(t) = \vr_0 + t\vv$ define a linear function $\vr$ in space through the terminal point of the vector $\vr_0$ in the direction of the vector $\vv$, tracing out a line in space.
\item A plane in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point perpendicular to a fixed vector.
\item If $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ are non-collinear points in space, the vectors $\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}$ and and $\overrightarrow{P_1P_3}$  are vectors in the plane and the vector $\vn = \overrightarrow{P_1P_2} \times \overrightarrow{P_1P_3}$ is a normal vector to the plane. So any point $P$ in the plane satisfies the equation $\overrightarrow{PP_1} \cdot \vn = 0$.  If we let $P = (x,y,z)$, $\vn = \langle a,b,c \rangle$ be the normal vector, and $P_1 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)$, we can also represent the plane with the equation
$$a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0.$$
