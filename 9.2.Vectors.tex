\subsection*{Introduction}

If we are at a point $x$ in the domain of a function of one variable,
there are only two directions in which we can move: in the positive or
negative $x$-direction. If, however, we are at a point $(x,y)$ in the domain of
a function of two variables, there are many
directions in which we can move. Thus, it is important for us to have
a means to indicate direction, and we will do so using vectors.

\subsection*{Representations of Vectors}

Preview Activity \ref{PA:9.2} shows how we can record the magnitude
and direction of a change in position using an ordered pair of numbers
$\langle x,y\rangle$. There are many other quantities, such as force
and velocity, that possess the attributes of magnitude and direction,
and we will call each such quantity a {\em vector}.

\vspace*{5pt}

  \parbox{6.25 in}{\begin{definition} A
      \textbf{vector}\index{vector!definition} is any quantity
      that possesses the attributes of magnitude and
      direction. \end{definition} } \hspace*{3 pt}} \vspace*{5pt}

We can represent a vector geometrically as a directed line segment,
with the magnitude as the length of the segment and an arrowhead
indicating direction, as shown in Figure \ref{F:9.2.vectors.single}.

    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


According to the definition, a vector possesses the attributes of
length (magnitude) and direction; the vector's position, however, is
not mentioned.  Consequently, we regard as equal any two vectors having the
same magnitude and direction, as shown in Figure
\ref{F:9.2.vectors.many}.

\vspace*{5pt}

\begin{center}

  }
\end{center}
\vspace*{5pt}

This means that the same vector may be drawn in the plane in many
different ways.  For instance, suppose that we would like to draw the
vector $\langle 3, 4\rangle$, which
represents a horizontal
change of three units and a vertical change of four units.
We may place the \emph{tail} of the vector (the point from which the
vector originates) at the origin and the \emph{tip} (the terminal
point of the vector) at $(3,4)$, as illustrated in Figure
\ref{F:9.2.vectors2}.  A vector with its tail at the origin is
said to be in \emph{standard position}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \begin{minipage}{3.0in}

        % \resizebox{!}{1.75in}{\includegraphics{9_2_Vector2}}

    \begin{minipage}{3.0in}

      \caption{A vector between two points}
      \label{F:9.2.vectors3}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Alternatively, we may place the tail of the vector $\langle
3,4\rangle$ at another point, such as $Q(1,1)$.  After a displacement
of three units to the right and four units up, the tip of
the vector is at the point $R(4,5)$ (see
Figure \ref{F:9.2.vectors3}).

In this example, the vector led to the directed line segment from $Q$
to $R$, which we denote as $\overrightarrow{QR}$.  We may also
turn the situation around: given the two points $Q$ and $R$, we obtain
the vector $\langle 3,4\rangle$ because we move horizontally three
units and vertically four units to get from $Q$ to $R$.  In other
words, $\overrightarrow{QR} = \langle 3,4\rangle$.  In general, the
vector $\overrightarrow{QR}$ from the point $Q = (q_1, q_2)$ to $R = (r_1,
r_2)$ is found by taking the difference of coordinates, so that
\[\overrightarrow{QR} = \langle r_1-q_1, r_2-q_2 \rangle.\]

We will use boldface letters to represent vectors, such
as $\vv = \langle 3, 4 \rangle$, to distinguish them from scalars. The
entries of a vector are called its \emph{components}; in the vector
$\langle 3, 4 \rangle$, the $x$ component is 3 and the $y$
component is 4. We use pointed brackets $\langle \ , \rangle$ and the term
\emph{components} to distinguish a vector from a point $( \ , )$ and
its \emph{coordinates}.  There is, however, a close connection between vectors
and points.  Given a point $P$, we will frequently consider the vector
$\overrightarrow{OP}$ from the origin $O$ to $P$.  For instance, if
$P=(3,4)$, then $\overrightarrow{OP}=\langle 3,4\rangle$ as in Figure \ref{F:9.2.vectors4}.  
In this way, we think of a point $P$ as defining a vector
$\overrightarrow{OP}$ whose components agree with the coordinates of
$P$.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

While we often illustrate vectors in the plane since it is easier
to draw pictures, different situations call for the use of vectors
in three or more dimensions.  For instance, a
vector $\vv$ in $n$-dimensional space, $\R^n$, has $n$
components and may be represented as
\[\vv = \langle v_1, v_2, v_3,  \ldots, v_n \rangle.\]

The next activity will help us to become accustomed to vectors and
operations on vectors in three dimensions.

\subsection*{Equality of Vectors}

Because location is not mentioned in the
definition of a vector, any two vectors that have the same
magnitude and direction are equal. It is helpful to have an
algebraic way to determine when this occurs. That is, if we know the
components of two vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$, we will want to be able to
determine algebraically when $\vu$ and $\vv$ are equal. There is an
obvious set of conditions that we use.

  \parbox{6.25 in}{Two vectors $\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle$ and $\vv = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle$ in $\R^2$ are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal:  $u_1 = v_1$ and $u_2 = v_2$.  More generally, two vectors $\vu = \langle u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\rangle$ and $\vv = \langle v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \rangle$ in $\R^n$ are equal if and only if $u_i = v_i$ for each possible value of $i$.
 } \hspace*{3 pt}} \vspace*{5pt}

\subsection*{Operations on Vectors}

Vectors are not numbers, but we can now represent them with components
that are real numbers. As such, we naturally wonder if it is possible
to add two vectors together, multiply two vectors, or combine vectors
in any other ways. In this section, we will study two
operations on vectors: vector addition and scalar multiplication. To
begin, we investigate a natural way to add two vectors together, as
well as to multiply a vector by a scalar.

\input{activities/9.2.Act3}

%There is also a natural way to multiply a vector by a scalar (a real number).
%\input{activities/9.2.Act4}

We can now add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars, and thus we
can add together scalar multiples of vectors. This allows us to define
\emph{vector subtraction}\index{vector!subtraction}, $\vv - \vu$, as
the sum of $\vv$ and $-1$ times $\vu$, so that
\[\vv - \vu = \vv + (-1)\vu.\]

%\input{activities/9.2.Act5}


Using vector addition and scalar multiplication, we will often
represent vectors in terms of the special vectors $\vi =
\langle 1, 0 \rangle$ and $\vj = \langle 0,1 \rangle$.  For instance,
we can write 
the vector $\langle a, b \rangle$ in $\R^2$ as
\[\langle a, b \rangle = a\langle 1, 0 \rangle + b\langle 0, 1 \rangle = a\vi + b \vj,\]
which means that
\[\langle 2, -3 \rangle = 2\vi - 3\vj.\]
In the context of $\R^3$, we let $\vi = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle$, $\vj = \langle 0,1,0 \rangle$, and $\vk = \langle 0,0,1 \rangle$, and we can write the vector $\langle a, b, c \rangle$ in $\R^3$ as
\[\langle a, b,c \rangle = a\langle 1, 0,0 \rangle + b\langle 0, 1,0 \rangle + c\langle 0,0,1 \rangle = a\vi + b \vj + c\vk.\]
The vectors $\vi$, $\vj$, and $\vk$ are called the \emph{standard unit vectors}\footnote{As we will learn momentarily, unit vectors have length 1.}, and are important in the physical sciences.

\subsection*{Properties of Vector Operations}

We know that the scalar sum $1+2$ is equal to the scalar sum
$2+1$. This is called the \emph{commutative} property of scalar
addition. Any time we define operations on objects (like addition of
vectors) we usually want to know what kinds of properties the
operations have. For example, is addition of vectors a commutative
operation? To answer this question we take two \emph{arbitrary}
vectors $\vv$ and $\vu$ and add them together and see what
happens. Let $\vv = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle$ and $\vu = \langle u_1,
u_2 \rangle$. Now we use the fact that $v_1$, $v_2$, $u_1$, and $u_2$
are scalars, and that the addition of scalars is commutative to see
that
\[\vv + \vu = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle + \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle = \langle v_1+u_1, v_2 + u_2 \rangle = \langle u_1+v_1, u_2+v_2 \rangle = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle + \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle = \vu + \vv.\]
So the vector sum is a commutative operation. Similar arguments can be
used to show the following properties of vector addition and scalar
multiplication. 

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{Let $\vv$, $\vu$, and $\vw$ be vectors in $\R^n$ and let $a$ and $b$ be scalars. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\vv + \vu = \vu + \vv$
\item $(\vv + \vu) + \vw = \vv + (\vu + \vw)$
\item The vector $\vzero = \langle 0, 0, \ldots, 0 \rangle$ has the
  property that $\vv + \vzero = \vv$. The vector $\vzero$ is called
  the \textbf{zero vector}. 
\item  $(-1)\vv + \vv = \vzero$. The vector $(-1)\vv = -\vv$ is called
  the \textbf{additive inverse} of the vector $\vv$. 
\item $(a+b) \vv = a\vv + b\vv$
\item $a(\vv + \vu) = a\vv + a\vu$
\item $(ab) \vv = a(b\vv)$
\item $1 \vv = \vv$.
\end{enumerate}
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

We verified the first property for vectors in $\R^2$; it is
straightforward to verify that the rest of the eight properties just
noted hold for all 
vectors in $\R^n$. 

\subsection*{Geometric Interpretation of Vector Operations}

Next, we explore a geometric interpretation of vector addition and
scalar multiplication that allows us to visualize these operations.
Let $\vu = \langle 4, 6 \rangle$ and $\vv = \langle 3, -2
\rangle$. Then $\vw = \vu + \vv = \langle 7, 4 \rangle$, as shown on the left in
Figure \ref{F:9.2.vector_sum}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_2_operations.eps}
  \caption{A vector sum (left), summing displacements (center), the parallelogram law (right)}

\end{figure}

% \end{center}
% \caption{{Summing displacements}}
% \label{F:9.2.vector_sum2}
% \end{minipage}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure}

If we think of these vectors as displacements in the plane, we 
find a geometric way to envision vector addition.  For instance, the
vector $\vu + \vv$ will represent the displacement obtained by
following the displacement $\vu$ with the displacement $\vv$.  We may
picture this by placing the tail of $\vv$ at the tip of $\vu$, as seen
in the center of Figure \ref{F:9.2.vector_sum}.

Of course, vector addition is commutative so we obtain the same sum if
we place the tail of $\vu$ at the tip of $\vv$.
We therefore see that $\vu+\vv$ appears as
the 
diagonal of the
parallelogram\index{vector!sum, parallelogram} determined by $\vu$ and
$\vv$, as shown on the right of Figure \ref{F:9.2.vector_sum}.

% \caption{{$\vu$ and $\vv$} form a parallelogram}
% \label{F:9.2.vector_sum4}
% \end{minipage}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure}

Vector subtraction has a similar interpretation.  On the left in
Figure \ref{F:9.2.vector_sum5}, we see vectors $\vu$, $\vv$, and $\vw =
\vu + \vv$.  If we rewrite $\vv = \vw - \vu$, we have the arrangement
of Figure \ref{F:9.2.vector_sum6}.  In other words, to form the
difference $\vw-\vu$, we draw a vector from the tip of $\vu$ to the
tip of $\vw$. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{minipage}{2.5in}
%    \begin{minipage}{2in}
      \begin{center}
        % \resizebox{!}{2.5in}{\includegraphics{9_2_Vector_sum1}}

      \caption{Vector subtraction}
      \label{F:9.2.vector_sum6}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

In a similar way, we may geometrically represent a scalar multiple of a
vector.  For instance, if $\vv=\langle 2,3\rangle$, then
$2\vv = \langle 4,6\rangle$.  As shown in Figure
\ref{F:9.2.vector_sum7}, multiplying $\vv$ by 2 leaves the direction
unchanged, but stretches $\vv$ by 2.  Also, $-2\vv = \langle -4,
-6\rangle$, which shows that multiplying by a negative scalar gives a
vector pointing in the opposite direction of $\vv$.

\subsection*{The Magnitude of a Vector}

By definition, vectors have both direction and magnitude (or
length). We now investigate how to calculate the magnitude
of a vector.  Since a vector $\vv$ can be represented
by a directed line segment, we can use the distance formula to
calculate the length of the segment. This length is the
\emph{magnitude} of the vector $\vv$ and is denoted $|\vv|$.

\item A vector is any object that possesses the attributes of
  magnitude and direction. Examples of vector quantities are position,
  velocity, acceleration, and force.  
\item Two vectors are equal if they have the
  same direction and magnitude. Notice that position is not considered, so a vector is independent of its location.
\item If $\vu = \langle u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n \rangle$ and $\vv =
  \langle v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \rangle$ are two vectors in $\R^n$,
  then their vector sum is the vector
\[\vu + \vv = \langle u_1+v_1, u_2+v_2, \ldots, u_n+v_n \rangle.\]
If $\vu = \langle u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n \rangle$ is a vector in $\R^n$
and $c$ is a scalar, then the scalar multiple $c\vu$ is the vector
 \[c\vu = \langle cu_1, cu_2, \ldots, cu_n \rangle.\]
\item The magnitude of the vector $\vv = \langle v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n
  \rangle$ in $\R^n$ is the scalar
  \[|\vv| = \sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+ \cdots + v_n^2}.\] A vector $\vu$ is a
  unit vector provided that $|\vu| = 1$. If $\vv$ is a nonzero vector,
  then the vector $\frac{\vv}{|\vv|}$ is a unit vector with the same
  direction as $\vv$.
