\end{goals}} \hspace*{3 pt}}

The last two sections have introduced some basic algebraic operations
on vectors---addition, scalar multiplication, and the dot
product---with useful geometric interpretations.  In
this section, we will meet a final algebraic operation, the {\em cross
  product}, which again conveys important geometric information.

To begin, we must emphasize that the cross product is only defined for
vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ in $\R^3$.  
Also, remember that we use a right-hand coordinate
system, as described in Section \ref{S:9.1.Functions}.  In
particular, recall that the vectors $\vi$, $\vj$, and $\vk$ are
oriented as shown below in Figure \ref{F:9.4.basis}.  Earlier, we
noticed that if we point the index finger of our {\em right} hand in
the direction of $\vi$ and our middle finger in the direction of
$\vj$, then our thumb points in the direction of $\vk$.

\subsection*{Computing the cross product}

As we have seen in Preview Activity \ref{PA:9.4}, the cross product
$\vu\times\vv$ is defined for two vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ in $\R^3$
and produces another vector in $\R^3$.
Using the right-hand rule, we saw that

\begin{table}[ht]
  \label{T:9.4.cross.basis}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
      $\vi\times\vj = \vk,$ \hspace*{1in} &
      $\vi\times\vk = -\vj,$ \hspace*{1in} &
      $\vj\times\vk = \vi$\hspace*{1in} \\ \\
      $\vj\times\vi = -\vk$ &
      $\vk\times\vi = \vj$ &
      $\vk\times\vj = -\vi$
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

If in addition we apply the bilinearity property to compute the cross product
in terms of the components of general vectors, $\vu$ and $\vv$ we see that\footnote{Like the dot product, the cross product arises in physical applications, e.g., torque, but is it more convenient mathematically to begin from an algebraic perspective.} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \vu\times\vv & = & (u_1\vi + u_2\vj + u_3\vk) \times 
  (v_1\vi + v_2\vj + v_3\vk) \\
  & = & u_1\vi\times  (v_1\vi + v_2\vj + v_3\vk)+ \\
  & & u_2\vj\times  (v_1\vi + v_2\vj + v_3\vk)+ \\
  & & u_3\vk\times  (v_1\vi + v_2\vj + v_3\vk) \\
  & = & u_1v_1\vi\times\vi + u_1v_2\vi\times\vj + u_1v_3\vi\times\vk +\\
  &  & u_2v_1\vj\times\vi + u_2v_2\vj\times\vj + u_2v_3\vj\times\vk + \\
  &  & u_3v_1\vk\times\vi + u_3v_2\vk\times\vj + u_3v_3\vk\times\vk
  \\
  & = & u_1v_2\vk - u_1v_3\vj - u_2v_1\vk + u_2v_3\vi +u_3v_1\vj -
  u_3v_2\vi \\
  & = & (u_2v_3-u_3v_2)\vi - (u_1v_3-u_3v_1)\vj + (u_1v_2-u_2v_1)\vk
\end{eqnarray*}
To summarize, we have shown that
\begin{equation}\label{E:9.4.cross.def}
(u_1\vi + u_2\vj + u_3\vk) \times 
  (v_1\vi + v_2\vj + v_3\vk) = 
(u_2v_3-u_3v_2)\vi - (u_1v_3-u_3v_1)\vj + (u_1v_2-u_2v_1)\vk.
\end{equation}

At first, this may look intimidating and difficult
to remember.  However, if we rewrite the expression in Equation~\eqref{E:9.4.cross.def} using determinants, 
important structure emerges.  The determinant of a $2\times2$ matrix is
$$
\left|
  \begin{array}{cc}
    a & b \\
    c & d 
  \end{array}
\right|
=ad - bc.$$
It follows that we can thus rewrite Equation~\eqref{E:9.4.cross.def} in the form
$$
\vu\times\vv = 
\left|
  \begin{array}{cc}
    u_2 & u_3 \\
    v_2 & v_3 \\
  \end{array}
\right| \vi
-
\left|
  \begin{array}{cc}
    u_1 & u_3 \\
    v_1 & v_3 \\
  \end{array}
\right| \vj
+
\left|
  \begin{array}{cc}
    u_1 & u_2 \\
    v_1 & v_2 \\
  \end{array}
\right| \vk.
$$
For those familiar with the determinant of a $3\times3$ matrix, we
write the mnemonic
$$
\vu\times\vv = 
\left|
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    \vi & \vj & \vk \\
    u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
    v_1 & v_2 & v_3
  \end{array}
\right|.
$$

The cross product satisfies the following properties, which were
illustrated in Preview Activity \ref{PA:9.4} and may be easily
verified from the definition (\ref{E:9.4.cross.def}).

\vspace*{5pt}

    Let $\vu$, $\vv$, and $\vw$ be vectors in $\R^3$, and
    let $c$ be a scalar. Then 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\vu \times \vv = -(\vv \times \vu)$
    \item $(c\vu +\vv)\times \vw = c(\vu \times \vw) + \vv \times \vw$
    \item $\vu\times\vv = \vzero$ if $\vu$ and $\vv$ are parallel.
    \item The cross product is not associative;  that is, in general
      $$(\vu\times\vv)\times\vw \neq \vu\times(\vv\times\vw).$$
    \end{enumerate}
  } 
  \hspace*{3 pt}
}
\vspace*{5pt}

Just as we found for the dot product, the cross product provides us
with useful geometric information.  In particular, both the length and
direction of the cross product $\vu\times\vv$ encode information about
the geometric relationship between $\vu$ and $\vv$.

\subsection*{The Length of $\vu\times\vv$}

We may ask whether the length $|\vu\times\vv|$ has any relationship to
the lengths of $\vu$ and $\vv$.  To investigate, we will compute the
square of the length $|\vu\times\vv|^2$ and denote by $\theta$ the
angle between $\vu$ and $\vv$, as in Section \ref{S:9.3.Dot_Product}.
Doing so, we find through some significant algebra that

\begin{eqnarray*}
  |\vu\times\vv|^2&=&(u_2v_3-u_3v_2)^2 + (u_1v_3-u_3v_1)^2 +
  (u_1v_2-u_2v_1)^2 \\
  &=&
  u_2^2 v_3^2- 2u_2u_3v_2v_3 +u_3^2v_2^2 +
  u_1^2 v_3^2 -2u_1u_3v_1v_3 +u_3^2v_1^2 +
  u_1^2 v_2^2 -2u_1u_2v_1v_2 +u_2^2v_1^2 \\
  &=&
  u_1^2(v_2^2+v_3^2) + u_2^2(v_1^2+v_3^2) + u_3^2(v_1^2+v_2^2) -
  2(u_1u_2v_1v_2 + u_1u_3v_1v_3 + u_2u_3v_2v_3) \\
  & = & 
  u_1^2(v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2) + u_2^2(v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2) +
  u_3^2(v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2) - \\
  & &
  (u_1^2v_1^2 + u_2^2v_2^2 + u_3^2v_3^2  + 
  2(u_1u_2v_1v_2 + u_1u_3v_1v_3 + u_2u_3v_2v_3)) \\
  &=&
  (u_1^2+u_2^2+u_3^2)(v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2)-(u_1v_1+u_2v_2+u_3v_3)^2  \\
  &=&
  |\vu|^2|\vv|^2-(\vu\cdot\vv)^2 \\
  &=&
  |\vu|^2|\vv|^2(1-\cos^2\theta) \\
  &=&|\vu|^2|\vv|^2\sin^2\theta. \\
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, we have found $|\vu\times\vv|^2 = |\vu|^2|\vv|^2\sin^2\theta$,
which means that
\begin{equation}
  \label{E:9.4.cross.length}
  |\vu\times\vv| = |\vu||\vv|\sin\theta.
\end{equation}
 Note that the third property stated above says that $\vu\times\vv = \vzero$ if
$\vu$ and $\vv$ are parallel.  This is reflected in
Equation~(\ref{E:9.4.cross.length}) since $\sin\theta=0$ if $\vu$ and $\vv$ are
parallel, which implies that $\vu\times\vv = \vzero$.

Equation (\ref{E:9.4.cross.length}) also has a geometric implication.
Consider the parallelogram formed by two vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$, as
shown in Figure \ref{F:9.4.area}.  

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_4_area.eps}
    \caption{The parallelogram formed by $\vu$ and $\vv$}
    \label{F:9.4.area}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


Remember that the area of a parallelogram is the product of its
base and height.  As shown in the figure, we may consider the base of
the parallelogram to be $|\vu|$ and the height to be
$|\vv|\sin\theta$.  This means that the area of the parallelogram
formed by $\vu$ and $\vv$ is 
$$
|\vu||\vv|\sin\theta = |\vu\times\vv|.
$$
This leads to the following interesting fact.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{
  The length, $|\vu \times \vv|$, of the cross product of vectors $\vu$
  and $\vv$ is the area of the parallelogram determined by $\vu$
  and $\vv$.  
} \hspace*{3 pt}} \vspace*{5pt}

\input{activities/9.4.Act4}


\subsection*{The Direction of $\vu\times\vv$}

Now that we understand the length of $\vu\times\vv$, we will
investigate its direction.  Remember from Preview Activity
\ref{PA:9.4} that cross products involving the vectors $\vi$, $\vj$,
and $\vk$ resulted in vectors that are orthogonal to the two terms.
We will see that this holds more generally.

We begin by computing $\vu\cdot(\vu\times\vv)$, and see that
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \vu\cdot(\vu\times\vv)&=&u_1(u_2v_3-u_3v_2) - u_2(u_1v_3-u_3v_1) +
  u_3(u_1v_2-u_2v_1) \\
  &=&u_1u_2v_3 - u_1u_3v_2 - u_2u_1v_3+u_2u_3v_1 + u_3u_1v_2 -
  u_3u_2v_1 \\
  &=&0
\end{eqnarray*}
To summarize, we have $\vu\cdot(\vu\times\vv) = 0$, which implies that
$\vu$ is orthogonal to $\vu\times\vv$.  In the same way, we can show that
$\vv$ is orthogonal to $\vu\times\vv$.  The net effect is that
$\vu\times\vv$ is a vector that is perpendicular to both $\vu$ and $\vv$, and
hence $\vu\times\vv$ is perpendicular to the plane determined
by $\vu$ and $\vv$.  Moreover, the direction of $\vu\times\vv$ is
determined by applying the right-hand rule to $\vu$ and $\vv$, as we
saw in Preview Activity \ref{PA:9.4}.  In light of our earlier work that showed 
$
|\vu||\vv|\sin\theta = |\vu\times\vv|.
$, we may now express $\vu \times \vv$ in the following different way.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{
  Suppose that $\vu$ and $\vv$ are not parallel and that 
  $\vn$ is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing $\vu$
  and $\vv$ determined by the right-hand rule.  Then
  $$
  \vu\times\vv = |\vu||\vv|\sin\theta ~\vn.
  $$
} \hspace*{3 pt}} \vspace*{5pt}

There is yet one more geometric implication we may draw from this
result.  Suppose $\vu$, $\vv$, and $\vw$ are vectors in $\R^3$ that
are not coplanar and that form a three-dimension parallelepiped as
shown in Figure
\ref{F:9.4.volume}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_4_volume.eps}
    \caption{The parallelepiped determined by $\vu$, $\vv$, and $\vw$}
    \label{F:9.4.volume}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The volume of the parallelepiped is determined by multiplying $A$, the
area of the base, by the height $h$.  As we have just seen, the area
of the base is $|\vu\times\vv|$.  Moreover, the height
$h=|\vw|\cos\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is the angle between $\vw$ and the
vector $\vn$, which is orthogonal to the plane formed by $\vu$ and
$\vv$.  Since $\vn$ is parallel to $\vu\times\vv$, the angle between
$\vw$ and $\vu\times\vv$ is also $\alpha$.  This shows that
$$
|(\vu\times\vv)\cdot\vw| = |\vu\times\vw||\vw|\cos\alpha = Ah,
$$
and therefore 

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{
  The volume of the parallelepiped determined by $\vu$, $\vv$, and
  $\vw$ is $|(\vu\times\vv)\cdot\vw|$.
}
\hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

The quantity $|(\vu \times
  \vv) \cdot \vw|$ is sometimes called the \emph{scalar triple product}.

\subsection*{Torque is measured by a cross product}

We have seen that the cross product enables us to produce a vector
perpendicular to two given vectors, to measure the area of a
parallelogram, and to measure the volume of a parallelepiped.  Besides
these geometric applications, the cross product also enables us to
describe a physical quantity called {\em torque}.

Suppose that we would like to turn a bolt using a wrench as shown
in Figure \ref{F:9.4.wrench}.  If a force $\vF$ is applied to the
wrench and $\vr$ is the vector from the position on the wrench at which the force is applied to center of the bolt, we define the
torque, $\tau$, to be
$$
\tau=\vF\times\vr.
$$

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_4_wrench.eps}
    \caption{A force applied to a wrench}
    \label{F:9.4.wrench}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

When a force is applied to an object, Newton's Second Law tells us
that the force is equal to the rate of change of the object's linear
momentum.  Similarly, the torque applied to an object is equal to the
rate of change of the object's angular momentum.  In other words,
torque will cause the bolt to rotate.

In many industrial applications, bolts are required to be tightened
using a specified torque.  Of course, the magnitude of the torque is
$|\tau| =|\vF\times\vr|=|\vF||\vr||\sin(\theta)$.  Thus, to produce a
larger torque, we can increase either $|\vF|$ or $|\vr|$, which you
may know if you have ever removed lug nuts when changing a flat tire.
The ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes said: ``Give me a lever
long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the
world.''  A modern spin on this statement is: ``Allow me to make
$|\vr|$ large enough, and I shall produce a torque large enough to
move the world.''

\subsection*{Comparing the dot and cross products}

Finally, it is worthwhile to compare and contrast the dot and cross
products.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] $\vu\cdot\vv$ is a scalar, while $\vu\times\vv$ is a vector.
  \item[(b)] $\vu\cdot\vv = \vv\cdot\vu$, while $\vu\times\vv = -\vv\times\vu$
  \item[(c)] $\vu\cdot\vv = |\vu||\vv|\cos\theta$, while 
    $|\vu\times\vv| = |\vu||\vv|\sin\theta$.
  \item[(d)] $\vu\cdot\vv = 0$ if $\vu$ and $\vv$ are perpendicular, while
    $\vu\times\vv = \vzero$ if $\vu$ and $\vv$ are parallel.
\end{itemize}

\begin{summary}
\item The cross product is defined \emph{only} for vectors in
  $\R^3$. The cross product of vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ in $\R^3$ is
  the vector
\[(u_1 \vi + u_2 \vj + u_3 \vk) \times (v_1 \vi + v_2 \vj + v_3 \vk) =
(u_2v_3-u_3v_2) \vi - (u_1v_3 - u_3v_1) \vj + (u_1v_2 - u_2v_1) \vk.\]

\item Geometrically, the cross product is
\[\vu \times \vv = |\vu| \ |\vv| \ \sin(\theta) \ \vn,\]
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vu$ and $\vv$ and $\vn$ is a
unit vector perpendicular to both $\vu$ and $\vv$ as determined by the
right-hand rule.

\item The cross product of vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ is a vector
  perpendicular to both $\vu$ and $\vv$. 

\item The magnitude $|\vu \times \vv|$ of the cross product of the
  vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ gives the area of the parallelogram
  determined by $\vu$ and $\vv$. Also, 
  the scalar triple product $|(\vu \times
  \vv) \cdot \vw|$ gives the volume of the parallelepiped determined by
  $\vu$, $\vv$, and $\vw$.
