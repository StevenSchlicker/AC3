\subsection*{Introduction}

Throughout our mathematical careers we have studied functions of a
single variable. We define a function of one variable as a rule that
assigns exactly one output to each input. We analyze these functions
by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating,
integrating, and more. In this and following sections, we will study
functions whose input is defined in terms of more than one variable,
and then analyze these functions by looking at their graphs,
calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. We will
see that many of the ideas from single variable calculus translate
well to functions of several variables, but we will have to make some
adjustments as well.

\subsection*{Functions of Several Variables}

Suppose we launch a projectile, using a golf club, a cannon, or some
other device, from ground level. Under ideal conditions (ignoring wind
resistance, spin, or any other forces except the force of gravity) the
horizontal distance the object will travel depends on the initial
velocity $x$ the object is given, and the angle $y$ at which it is
launched. If we let $f$ represent the horizontal distance the object
travels (its range), then $f$ is a function of the two variables $x$
and $y$, and we represent $f$ in functional notation by
\[f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{g},\] where $g$ is the acceleration
due to gravity.\footnote{We will derive this equation in a later section.}

\parbox{6.25 in}{\begin{definition} A \textbf{function $f$ of two independent variables}\index{function!of two variables} is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair $(x,y)$ in some set $D$ exactly one real number $f(x,y)$. \end{definition}
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}


There is, of course, no reason to restrict ourselves to functions of
only two variables---we can use any number of variables we like. For
example,
\[f(x,y,z) = x^2 - 2xz + \cos(y)\] 
defines $f$ as a function of the
three variables $x$, $y$, and $z$. In general, a function of $n$
independent variables is a rule that assigns to an ordered $n$-tuple
$(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ in some set $D$ exactly one real number.

As with functions of a single variable, it is important to understand
the set of inputs for which the function is defined.

\subsection*{Representing Functions of Two Variables}

One of the techniques we use to study functions of one
variable is to create a table of values. We can do the same for
functions of two variables, except that our tables will have to allow
us to keep track of both input variables. We can do this with a
2-dimensional table, where we list the $x$-values across the first row 
and the $y$-values down the first column. Let $f$ be the function
defined by $f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}$ that gives the range of a
projectile as a function of the initial velocity $x$ and launch angle
$y$ of the projectile. The value $f(x,y)$ is then displayed in the
location where the $x$ row intersects the $y$ column, as shown in
Table \ref{T:9.1.range} (where we measure $x$ in feet and $y$ in
radians).

If $f$ is a function of a single variable $x$, then we define the
graph of $f$ to be the set of points of the form $(x,f(x))$, where $x$
is in the domain of $f$. We then plot these points using the
coordinate axes in order to visualize the graph. We can do a similar
thing with functions of several variables. Table \ref{T:9.1.range}
identifies points of the form $(x,y,f(x,y))$, and we define the graph
of $f$ to be the set of these points.

 \vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{\begin{definition} The \textbf{graph}\index{function!graph} of a function $f = f(x,y)$ is the set of points of the form $(x,y,f(x,y))$, where the point $(x,y)$ is in the domain of $f$. \end{definition}
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

We also often refer to the graph of a function $f$ of two variables as
the \emph{surface}\index{function!surface} generated by $f$. Points in
the form $(x,y,f(x,y))$ are in three dimensions, so plotting these
points takes a bit more work than graphs of functions in two
dimensions. To plot these three-dimensional points, we need to set up
a coordinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes -- the
$x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the $z$-axis (called the \emph{coordinate
  axes}). There are essentially two different ways we could set up a
3D coordinate system, as shown in Figures \ref{F:9.1.right_hand} and
\ref{F:9.1.left_hand}; thus, before we can proceed, we need to
establish a convention.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{2.5in}
\begin{center}
%\resizebox{!}{1.5in}{\includegraphics{9_1_right_hand_system}}
  \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_1_right_hand.eps}
\caption{A right hand system}
\label{F:9.1.right_hand}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.5in}
\begin{minipage}{2.5in}
\begin{center}
%\resizebox{!}{1.5in}{\includegraphics{9_1_left_hand_system}}
  \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_1_left_hand.eps}
\caption{A left hand system}
\label{F:9.1.left_hand}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The distinction between these two figures is subtle, but important.
In the coordinate system shown in \ref{F:9.1.right_hand}, imagine that
you are sitting on the positive $z$-axis next to the label ``$z$.''
Looking down at the $x$- and $y$-axes, you see that the $y$-axis is
obtained by rotating the $x$-axis by 90$^\circ$ in the {\em
  counterclockwise} direction.  Again sitting on the positive $z$-axis
in Figure \ref{F:9.1.left_hand}, you see that the $y$-axis is obtained
by rotating the $x$-axis by 90$^\circ$ in the {\em clockwise}
direction.


We call the coordinate system in \ref{F:9.1.right_hand} a {\em
  right-hand system}; if we point the index finger of our {\em right}
hand along the positive $x$-axis and our middle finger along the
positive $y$-axis, then our thumb points in the direction of the
positive $z$-axis.  Following mathematical conventions, we choose to
use a right-hand system throughout this book.

% We will adopt a right-hand system\index{right hand system}, as illustrated in Figure \ref{F:9.1.right_hand}. To see the difference, think about a socket wrench -- a tool for driving screws. It consists of a handle and a socket. The socket is placed on the screw and attached to the handle. As the handle of the wrench is turned, the socket provides a force that drives the screw. If you point the index finger of your right hand in the direction of the force you apply to the handle of the wrench, and point your middle finger in the direction of the handle toward the socket, then your thumb will point in the direction in which the wrench is driving the screw. If you use your left hand instead, then your thumb will point in the opposite direction. So the socket wrench is set up to drive right-handed screws. This is exactly the 3D coordinate system we want to adopt. In a right hand system, if we point the index finger of our right hand in the direction of the positive $x$-axis and our middle finger in the direction of the positive $y$-axis, then our thumb will point in the direction of the positive $z$-axis. A left hand system and a right hand system have different orientations, so we need pick one as a standard so that the convention of orientation is understood by everyone. We will always use a right-hand system.

Now that we have established a convention for a right hand system, we can draw a graph of the range function, $f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}$. Note that the function $f$ is continuous in both variables, so when we plot these points in the right hand coordinate system, we can connect them all to form a surface in 3-space. The graph of the range function $f$ is shown in Figure \ref{F:9.1.range}.

There are many graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional
surfaces.\footnote{e.g., Wolfram Alpha and
  \url{http://web.monroecc.edu/manila/webfiles/calcNSF/JavaCode/CalcPlot3D.htm}}
Since we will be able to visualize graphs of functions of two
variables, but not functions of more than two variables, we will
primarily deal with functions of two variables in this course. It is
important to note, however, that the techniques we develop apply to
functions of any number of variables.
%We will work extensively with functions of several variables in subsequent sections.

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent \textbf{Notation:} We let $\R^2$ denote the set of all
ordered pairs of real numbers in the plane (two copies of the real
number system) and let $\R^3$ represent the set of all ordered triples
of real numbers (which constitutes three-space).

\vspace{10pt}

\subsection*{Some Standard Equations in Three-Space}

In addition to graphing functions, we will also want to understand
graphs of some simple equations in three dimensions. For example, in
$\R^2$, the graphs of the equations $x=a$ and $y=b$, where $a$ and $b$
are constants, are lines parallel to the coordinate axes. In the next
activity we consider their three-dimensional analogs.

\input{activities/9.1.Act3}

Activity \ref{A:9.1.3} shows that the equations where one independent
variable is constant lead to planes parallel to ones that result from
a pair of the coordinate axes. When we make the constant 0, we get the
\emph{coordinate planes}\index{coordinate planes}. The $xy$-plane
satisfies $z=0$, the $xz$-plane satisfies $y=0$, and the $yz$-plane
satisfies $z=0$ (see Figure \ref{F:9.1.coordinate_planes}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
%\resizebox{!}{1.25in}{\includegraphics{9_1_xy_plane}}
  \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_1_xy_plane.eps}
\hspace{0.2in}

  \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_1_yz_plane.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{The coordinate planes.}
\label{F:9.1.coordinate_planes}
\end{figure}

On a related note, we define a circle in $\R^2$ as the set of all
points equidistant from a fixed point. In $\R^3$, we call the set of
all points equidistant from a fixed point a
\emph{sphere}\index{sphere!definition}. To find the equation of a
sphere, we need to understand how to calculate the distance between
two points in three-space, and we explore this idea in the next
activity.

\input{activities/9.1.Act4}

The formula developed in Activity \ref{A:9.1.4} is important to remember.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{The distance between points $P=(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and $Q=(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ (denoted as $|PQ|$)  in $\R^3$ is given by the formula
\begin{equation} \label{eq:9.1.Distance_3D}
|PQ| = \sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2 + (z_1-z_0)^2}.
\end{equation}
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

Equation (\ref{eq:9.1.Distance_3D}) can be used to derive the formula
for a sphere\index{sphere!formula} centered at a point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$
with radius $r$. Since the distance from any point $(x,y,z)$ on such a
sphere to the point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is $r$, the point $(x,y,z)$ will
satisfy the equation
\[\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2} = r\]
%or
%\[(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2.\]
Squaring both sides, we come to the standard equation for a sphere.

\vspace*{5pt}
\nin \framebox{\hspace*{3 pt}
\parbox{6.25 in}{The equation of a sphere with center $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ and radius $r$ is
\[(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2.\]
} \hspace*{3 pt}}
\vspace*{5pt}

This makes sense if we compare this equation to its two-dimensional
analogue, the equation of a circle of radius $r$ in the plane centered
at $(x_0,y_0)$:
$$
(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 = r^2.
$$

\subsection*{Traces}

When we study functions of several variables we are often interested
in how each individual variable affects the function in and of
itself. In Preview Activity \ref{PA:9.1}, we saw that the monthly
payment on an \$18,000 loan depends on the interest rate and the
duration of the loan. However, if we fix the interest rate, the
monthly payment depends only on the duration of the loan, and if we
set the duration the payment depends only on the interest rate. This
idea of keeping one variable constant while we allow the other to
change will be an important tool for us when studying functions of
several variables.

As another example, consider again the range function $f$ defined by
\[f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}\] where $x$ is the initial velocity
of an object in feet per second, $y$ is the launch angle in radians,
and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (32 feet per second
squared). If we hold the launch angle constant at $y=0.6$ radians, we
can consider $f$ a function of the initial velocity alone. In this
case we have
\[f(x) = \frac{x^2}{32}\sin(2\cdot 0.6).\]
We can plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the
surface when $y = 0.6$, as shown in Figure
\ref{F:9.1.trace1}. The graph and the formula clearly show that $f$ is
quadratic in the $x$-direction. More descriptively, as we increase the
launch velocity while keeping the launch angle constant, the range
increases proportional to the square of the initial velocity.

Similarly, if we fix the initial velocity at 150 feet per second, we
can consider the range as a function of the launch angle only. In this
case we have
\[f(y) = \frac{150^2 \sin(2y)}{32}.\] 
We can again plot this curve on
the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when $x=150$, as
shown in Figure \ref{F:9.1.trace2}. The graph and the formula clearly
show that $f$ is sinusoidal in the $y$-direction. More descriptively,
as we increase the launch angle while keeping the initial velocity
constant, the range is proportional to the sine of twice the launch
angle.

The curves we define when we fix one of the independent variables in our two variable function are called \emph{traces}.

\parbox{6.25 in}{\begin{definition} A \textbf{trace}\index{trace} of a function $f$ of two independent variables $x$ and $y$ is a curve of the form $z = f(c,y)$ or $z = f(x,c)$, where $c$ is a constant. \end{definition}

Understanding trends in the behavior of functions of two variables can
be challenging, as can sketching their graphs; traces help us with
each of these tasks.

\subsection*{Contour Maps and Level Curves}

We have all seen topographic maps such as the one of the Porcupine
Mountains in the upper peninsula of Michigan shown in Figure
\ref{F:9.1.porcupine}.\footnote{Map source: Michigan Department of
  Natural Resources,
  \url{https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10369_46675_58093---,00.html},
  with permission of the Michigan DNR and Bob Wild.} The curves on
these maps show the regions of constant altitude. The contours also
depict changes in altitude: contours that are close together signify
steep ascents or descents, while contours that are far apart indicate
only slight changes in elevation.  Thus, contour maps tell us a lot
about three-dimensional surfaces. Mathematically, if $f(x,y)$
represents the altitude at the point $(x,y)$, then each contour is the
graph of an equation of the form $f(x,y) = k$, for some constant $k$.

\vspace*{5pt}

Topographical maps can be used to create a three-dimensional surface
from the two-dimensional contours or level curves. For example, level
curves of the range function, $f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{32}$,
plotted in the $xy$-plane are shown in Figure
\ref{F:9.1.contours_1}. If we lift these contours and plot them at
their respective heights, then we get a picture of the surface itself,
as illustrated in Figure \ref{F:9.1.contours_2}.

The use of level curves and traces can help us construct the graph of
a function of two variables.

\input{activities/9.1.Act9}

%\input{activities/9.1.Act10}

The traces and level curves of a function of two variables are curves
in space. In order to understand these traces and level curves better,
we will first spend some time learning about vectors and vector-valued
functions in the next few sections and return to our study of
functions of several variables once we have those more mathematical
tools to support their study.

%\item A three-dimensional system has two possible orientations. In a right hand system, if we point the index finger of our right hand in the direction of the positive $x$-axis and our middle finger in the direction of the positive $y$-axis, then our thumb will point in the direction of the positive $z$-axis. A left hand system has a different orientation and we need pick one as a standard so that the convention of orientation is understood by everyone.
\item A function $f$ of several variables is a rule that assigns a unique number to an ordered collection of independent inputs.  The domain of a function of several variables is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined.
\item In $\R^3$, the distance between points $P=(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and $Q=(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ (denoted as $|PQ|$)  is given by the formula
\[|PQ| = \sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2 + (z_1-z_0)^2}.\]
and thus the equation of a sphere with center $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ and radius $r$ is
\[(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2.\]
\item A trace of a function $f$ of two independent variables $x$ and $y$ is a curve of the form $z = f(c,y)$ or $z = f(x,c)$, where $c$ is a constant. A trace tells us how the function depends on a single independent variable if we treat the other independent variable as a constant. 
\item A level curve of a function $f$ of two independent variables $x$ and $y$ is a curve of the form $k = f(x,y)$, where $k$ is a constant. A level curve describes the set of inputs that lead to a specific output of the function.
