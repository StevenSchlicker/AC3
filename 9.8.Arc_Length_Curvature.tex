\subsection*{Introduction}

Given a space curve, there are two natural
geometric questions one might ask: how long is the curve and how much
does it bend?  In this section, we answer both questions by
developing techniques for measuring the length of a space
curve as well as its curvature.

\subsection*{Arc Length}

Consider a smooth curve in 3-space that is parametrically described by
the  vector-valued function $\vr$ defined by $\vr(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t)
\rangle.$ 
Preview Activity
\ref{PA:9.8} shows that to approximate the
length of the curve defined by $\vr(t)$ as the values of $t$ run over
an interval $[a,b]$, we partition the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$
subintervals of equal length $\Delta t$, with $a = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots
< t_n = b$ as the endpoints of the subintervals. On each subinterval,
we approximate the length of the curve by the length of the line
segment connecting the endpoints. The points on the curve
corresponding to $t = t_{i-1}$ and $t = t_i$ are $(x(t_{i-1}),
y(t_{i-1}), z(t_{i-1}))$ and $(x(t_i), y(t_i), z(t_i))$, respectively,
so the length of the line segment connecting these points is
\[\sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) -
  z(t_{i-1}))^2}.\]
Now we add all of these approximations together to obtain an
approximation to the length $L$ of the curve:
\[L \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) -
  y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2}.\] 
We now want to take the limit of this sum as $n$ goes to infinity, but in its present form it
might be difficult to see how. We first introduce $\Delta t$ by multiplying by $\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t}$, and see that 
\begin{align*}
L &\approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2} \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2} \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t} \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1}))^2} \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{(\Delta t)^2}} 
\end{align*}
To get the difference quotients under the radical, we use properties of the square root function to see further that
\begin{align*}
L &\approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{\left[(x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1}))^2 + (z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1})^2\right] \frac{1}{(\Delta t)^2}} \Delta t \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{\left(\frac{x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2} \Delta t.
\end{align*}
Recall that as $n \to \infty$ we also have $\Delta t \to 0$. Since
\[\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t} = x'(t), \ \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t} = y'(t), \ \text{ and } \ \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t} = z'(t)\]
we see that
\begin{align}
L &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{\left(\frac{x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2} \Delta t \notag \\
    &= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{\left(\frac{x(t_i) - x(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y(t_i) - y(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{z(t_i) - z(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t}\right)^2} \Delta t \notag \\
    &= \int_a^b \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2} \, dt. \label{eq:9.8.arclength_1}
\end{align}

Noting further that
\[|\vr'(t)| = \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2},\]
we can rewrite (\ref{eq:9.8.arclength_1}) in a more succinct form as follows.

\vspace*{5pt}

Note that formula (\ref{eq:9.8.arclength_2}) applies to curves in any
dimensional space.  Moreover, this formula has a natural interpretation: if
$\vr(t)$ records the position of a moving object, then $\vr'(t)$ is
the object's velocity and $|\vr'(t)|$ its speed.  Formula
(\ref{eq:9.8.arclength_2}) says that we simply integrate the speed of
an object traveling over the curve to find the distance traveled by
the object, which is the same as the length of the curve,
just as in one-variable calculus.

We can adapt the arc length formula to curves in 2-space that define
$y$ as a function of $x$ as the following activity shows.

\input{activities/9.8.Act3}

\subsection*{Parameterizing With Respect To Arc Length}

In addition to helping us to find the length of space curves, the
expression for the length of a curve enables us to find a natural
parametrization of space curves in terms of arc length, as we now
explain. 

Shown below in Figure \ref{F.9.8.parametrization} is a portion of the
parabola $y = x^2/2$.  Of course, this space curve may be parametrized by 
the vector-valued function $\vr$ defined by $\vr(t) = \langle t, t^2/2\rangle$ as shown
on the left, where we see the location at a few different times $t$.
Notice that the points are not equally spaced on the curve.

A more natural parameter describing the points along the space curve
is the distance traveled $s$ as we move along the parabola starting at
the origin.  For instance, the right side of Figure
\ref{F.9.8.parametrization} shows the points corresponding to various
values of $s$.  We call this an {\em arc length parametrization}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figures/fig_9_8_param.eps}
    \caption{The parametrization $\vr(t)$ (left) and a
      reparametrization by arc length.}
    \label{F.9.8.parametrization}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To see that this is a more natural parametrization, consider an
interstate highway cutting across a state.  One way
to parametrize the curve defined by the highway is to drive along the
highway and record our position at every time, thus creating a
function $\vr$.  If we encounter an accident or road construction,
however,
this parametrization might not be at all relevant to another person
driving the same highway.  An arc length parametrization, however, is
like using the mile markers on the side of road to specify our
position on the highway.  If we know how far we've traveled along the
highway, we know exactly where we are.

If we begin with a parametrization of a space curve, we can
modify it to find an arc length parametrization, as we now describe.
Suppose that the curve is parametrized by the vector-valued function
$\vr = \vr(t)$ where $t$ is in the interval $[a,b]$.  We define the
parameter $s$ through the function
\[s=L(t) = \int_a^t \sqrt{(x'(w))^2 + (y'(w))^2 + (z'(w))^2} \,dw,\] 
which measures the length along the curve from $\vr(a)$ to
$\vr(t)$.  

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows us that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:9.8.arc_length_prime} \frac{ds}{dt} =
  L'(t)=
  \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2} = \lvert \vr'(t) \rvert
\end{equation}
and so
\[L(t) = \int_a^t \left| \frac{d}{dt}\vr(w)\right| \,dw.\] 
If we assume that $\vr'(t)$ is never 0, then $L'(t) > 0$ for all $t$
and $s=L(t)$ is always increasing. This should seem reasonable: unless we
stop, the distance traveled along the curve increases as we move along
the curve.

Since $s=L(t)$ is an increasing function, it is invertible, which means
we may view the time $t$ as a function of the distance traveled;  that
is, we have the relationship $t=L^{-1}(s)$.  We then obtain the arc length
parametrization by composing $\vr(t)$ with $t=L^{-1}(s)$ to obtain
$\vr(s)$.  Let's illustrate this with an example.

\begin{example} \label{ex:9.8.circle_arc_length} Consider a circle of
  radius $5$ in 2-space centered at the origin. We know that we can
  parameterize this circle as
  \[\vr(t) = \langle 5\cos t, 5\sin t \rangle, \]
  where $t$ runs from 0 to $2\pi$.  
  We see that $\vr'(t) = \langle -5\sin t, 5\cos t\rangle$, and hence
  $|\vr'(t)| = 5$.  It then follows that
  $$
  s=L(t) = \int_0^t |\vr'(w)|~dw = \int_0^t 5~dw = 5t.
  $$
  Since $s=L(t) = 5t$, we may solve for $t$ in terms of $s$ to obtain
  $t=L^{-1}(s) 
  = s/5$.  We then find the arc length parametrization by composing
  \[\vr(s)=\vr(L^{-1}(s)) = \left\langle 5\cos\left(\frac s5\right),
  5\sin\left(\frac s5\right)\right\rangle.\]


More generally, for a circle of radius $a$ centered at the origin, a
similar computation shows that
\begin{equation}
\vr(s) = \left\langle a\cos\left(\frac sa\right), a\sin\left(\frac sa\right)\right\rangle
\label{eq:9.8.circle_arc_length_parameterization}
\end{equation}
is an arc length parametrization.

\end{example}

Notice that equation (\ref{eq:9.8.arc_length_prime}) shows that 
\[\frac{d\vr}{dt} = \frac{d\vr}{ds}\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{d\vr}{ds}\lvert \vr'(t) \rvert,\]
so
\[\left| \frac{d\vr}{ds} \right| = \left|\frac{1}{\lvert \vr'(t) \rvert}\frac{d\vr}{dt} \right| = 1,\]
which means that we move along the curve with unit speed when we parameterize by arc length. This is clearly seen in Example \ref{ex:9.8.circle_arc_length} where $|\vr'(s)| = 1$. It follows that the parameter $s$ 
is the distance traveled along the curve, as shown by:
$$
L(s) = \int_0^s\left|\frac{d}{ds}\vr(w)\right|~dw = \int_0^s1~dw = s.
$$

\input{activities/9.8.Act4}

A little more complicated example is the following.

\begin{example} \label{ex:9.8.AL_curvature_ex_2}  Let us parameterize the curve defined by
\[\vr(t) = \left\langle t^2, \frac{8}{3}t^{3/2}, 4t \right\rangle\]
for $t \geq 0$ in terms of arc length. To write $t$ in terms of $s$ we find $s$ in terms of $t$:
\begin{align*}
s(t) &= \int_{0}^t \sqrt{(x'(w))^2 + (y'(w))^2 +(z'(w))^2} \, dw \\
    &= \int_0^t \sqrt{(2w)^2 + (4w^{1/2})^2 + (4)^2} \, dw \\
    &= \int_0^t \sqrt{4w^2 + 16w + 16} \, dw \\
    &= 2\int_0^t \sqrt{(w+2)^2} \, dw \\
    &= 2\int_0^t w+2 \, dw \\
    &= \left(w^2+4w\right)\biggm|_{0}^{t} \\
    &= t^2+4t.
\end{align*}
Since $t \geq 0$, we can solve the equation $s = t^2+4t$ (or $t^2+4t-s=0$) for $t$ to obtain $t = \frac{-4 +\sqrt{16+4s}}{2} = -2 + \sqrt{4+s}$. So we can parameterize our curve in terms of arc length by
\[\vr(s) = \left\langle \left(-2 + \sqrt{4+s}\right)^2, \frac{8}{3}\left(-2 + \sqrt{4+s}\right)^{3/2}, 4\left(-2 + \sqrt{4+s}\right) \right\rangle.\]

\end{example}

These examples illustrate a general method.  Of course, evaluating an
arc length integral and finding a formula for the
inverse of a function can be difficult, so while this process is
theoretically possible, it is not always practical to parameterize a
curve in terms of arc length. However, we can guarantee that such a
parameterization exists, and this observation plays an important role
in the next section. 

\subsection*{Curvature}

For a smooth space curve, the \emph{curvature} measures how fast the
curve is bending or changing direction at a given point. For example,
we expect that a line should have zero curvature everywhere, while a
circle (which is bending the same at every point) should have constant
curvature.  Circles with larger radii should have smaller curvatures.

To measure the curvature, we first need to describe the direction of
the curve at a point.  We may do this using a continuously varying
tangent vector to the curve, as shown in \ref{F:9.8.Curvature_1}.  
The direction of the curve is then determined by the angle $\phi$ this
tangent vector makes with a horizontal vector, as shown in
\ref{F:9.8.Curvature_angles}.

\label{F:9.8.Curvature_angles}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Informally speaking, the curvature will be
the rate at which the angle $\phi$ is changing as we move along the
curve.  Of course, this rate of change will depend on how we move
along the curve;  if we move with a greater speed along the curve,
then $\phi$ will change more rapidly.  This is why the speed limit is
sometimes lowered when we enter a curve on a highway.  In other words,
the rate of change of $\phi$ will depend on the parametrization we use
to describe the space curve.  To eliminate this dependence on the
parametrization, we choose to work with an arc
length parametrization $\vr(s)$, which means we move along the curve
with unit speed. 

Using an arc length parametrization $\vr(s)$, we define the tangent vector
$\vT(s) = \vr'(s)$, and note that $|\vT(s)| = 1$;  that is, $\vT(s)$ is
a unit tangent vector.  We then have $\vT(s) = \langle \cos (\phi(s)),
\sin(\phi(s)) \rangle$, 
which means that
$$\frac{d\vT}{ds} = \left\langle -\sin(\phi(s)) \frac{d\phi}{ds}, ~
\cos(\phi(s)) \frac{d\phi}{ds} \right\rangle = 
\langle -\sin(\phi(s)),~
\cos(\phi(s)) \rangle \frac{d\phi}{ds}.
$$
Therefore
$$\left|\frac{d\vT}{ds}\right| =  \left|\langle -\sin(\phi(s)),~
\cos(\phi(s)) \rangle\right| ~\left|\frac{d\phi}{ds}\right| = 
\left|\frac{d\phi}{ds}\right|$$.

This observation leads us to adopt

% We may describe the direction of the curve at a point using a unit

% \ref{F:9.8.Curvature_1}.  Of course, there are two choices of the unit

% A natural place to start to think about measuring curvature is to
% determine how fast the tangent vector is changing, or $|\vv'(t)|$, as
% illustrated in Figure \ref{F:9.8.Curvature_1}. However, $\vv'(t)$ is a
% function of time, and curvature should not depend on how fast we are
% traveling along the curve. How the curve is bending should be
% independent of how fast we travel along the curve. Think about driving
% a car around a curve -- the curve is the same regardless of how fast
% we drive, but you can feel the effect of the curve more if you drive
% through it faster. We need a way to measure curvature that does not
% depend on speed or parameterization. A next logical step is to try to
% remove the dependence on speed by making the speed constant, that is
% normalizing the velocity vector and consider using the \emph{unit
%   tangent vector}
% \[\vT(t) = \frac{\vv(t)}{\lvert \vv(t) \rvert}.\]
% We might then try to use $\lvert \vT'(t) \rvert$ as a measure of
% curvature. But this, too, has its problems. To see why, note that
% $\vr_1(t) = \langle t, t^2 \rangle$ and $\vr_2(t) = \langle 2t, 4t^2
% \rangle$ are two parameterizations of the parabola $y=x^2$. Their
% respective velocity vectors are $\vv_1(t) = \langle 1,2t\rangle$ and
% $\vv_2(t) = \langle 2, 8t \rangle$ and the respective unit tangent
% vectors are $\vT_1(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+4t^2}} \langle 1,2t\rangle$
% and $\vT_2(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+16t^2}} \langle 1,4t\rangle$. It
% follows that
% \[\left\lvert \vT'_1(t) \right\rvert = \frac{2}{1+4t^2} \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ \left\lvert \vT'_2(t) \right\rvert = \frac{4}{1+16t^2}.\]
% Now the point $(1,1)$ is the terminal point of $\vr_1(1)$ and $\vr_2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$, so we should expect the curvature of this curve to be the same whether we use the parameterization $\vr_1$ or $\vr_2$. But
% \[\frac{2}{1+4(1)^2} = \frac{2}{5} \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ \frac{4}{1+16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{4}{5}.\]
% So the value of  $\lvert \vT'(t) \rvert$ at a point depends on the parameterization we use. In other words, we still haven't removed the dependence on  how fast we travel along a curve. That is, $\lvert \vT'(t) \rvert$ still depends on the parameterization we choose.

% To remove the dependence of our computations on the parameterization, we need to take a different approach -- one that relies only on the geometric properties of the curve. A perfect method for this it to use the arc length parameterization discussed in the previous section. Even if we have different parameterizations of a curve, we travel the same distance when we move along the curve from point $P$ to point $Q$ regardless of how fast we go. In other words, arc length is independent of the parameterization, so arc length is the kind of parameter we want.

% We still want to measure the change in the unit tangent vectors, but the key is to parameterize the tangent vectors in terms of arc length. The magnitude of the change in the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length will tell us how fast the unit tangent vector is changing as the arc length changes, giving us a measure of the bend in the curve that does not depend on the parameterization. This is how we define curvature.

\begin{example} We should expect that the curvature of a line is 0
  everywhere. To show that our definition of curvature measures this
  correctly in 2-space, recall that
  (\ref{eq:9.8.line_arc_length_parameterization}) gives us the arc
  length parameterization
  \[x(s) = x_0+\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}s \ \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ \
  y(s) = y_0+\frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}s\] of a line. So the unit tangent vector is 
\[\vT(s) = \left\langle \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}},
  \frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} \right\rangle\] 
and, since $\vT(s)$ is constant, we have
\[\kappa = \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{ds} \right\rvert = 0\]
as expected.
\end{example}

\input{activities/9.8.Act5}

The definition of curvature relies on our
ability to parameterize curves in terms of arc length. Since we have
seen that finding an arc length parametrization can be difficult, we
would like to be able to express the curvature in terms of a more
general parametrization $\vr(t)$.

To begin, we need to describe the vector $\vT$, which is
a vector tangent to the curve having unit length.  Of course, the
velocity vector $\vr'(t)$ is tangent to the curve;  we simply need to
normalize its length to be one.  This means that we may take
$$
\vT(t) = \frac{\vr'(t)}{|\vr'(t)|}.
$$

Then the curvature of the curve defined by $\vr$ is
\begin{align*}
\kappa &= \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{ds} \right\rvert \\
    &= \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{dt} \frac{dt}{ds} \right\rvert \\
    &= \frac{\left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{dt} \right\rvert}{ \left\lvert \frac{ds}{dt} \right\rvert } \\
    &= \frac{\left\lvert \vT'(t) \right\rvert}{ \left\lvert \vr'(t) \right\rvert}.
\end{align*}

This last formula allows us to use any parameterization of a curve to
calculate its curvature. There is another useful formula, given
below, whose derivation is left for the exercises.

%Of course, we can calculate curvature in 3-space.

%\input{activities/9.8.Act7}

The curvature has another interpretation.  Recall that the tangent
line to a curve at a point is the line that best approximates the
curve at that point.  The curvature at a point on a curve describes
the {\em circle} that best approximates the curve at that point.
Remembering that a circle of radius $a$ has curvature $1/a$, then the
circle that best approximates the curve near a point on a curve whose
curvature is $\kappa$ has radius $1/\kappa$ and will be tangent to the
tangent line at that point.  This circle, called the {\em osculating
  circle} of the curve at the point, is shown in Figure
\ref{F:9.8.osculating} for a portion of a
parabola.

% We can interpret curvature in 2-space in an interesting way. Let $\vr(t)$ define a smooth curve in $\R^2$ and let $\phi$ be the angle that the tangent vector $\vr'(t)$ makes with the vector $\vi$, as shown in Figure \ref{F:9.8.Curvature_angles}. If $\vT$ is a unit tangent vector to the curve where $\phi$ is the angle between $\vT$ and $\vi$, then we can write $\vT$ as
% \[\vT = \langle \cos(\phi), \sin(\phi) \rangle.\]
% As a result, we have
% \[\frac{d \vT}{ds} = \frac{d \vT}{d \phi} \frac{d \phi}{ds},\]
% so
% \begin{align*}
% \kappa &= \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{ds} \right\rvert \\
%     &= \left\lvert \frac{d \vT}{d \phi} \right\rvert \ \left\lvert \frac{d \phi}{ds} \right\rvert \\
%     &= \left\lvert \langle -\sin(\phi), \cos(\phi) \right\rvert \ \left\lvert \frac{d \phi}{ds} \right\rvert \\
%     &= \sqrt{\sin^2(\phi) + \cos^2(\phi)} \left\lvert \frac{d \phi}{ds} \right\rvert \\
%     &= \left\lvert \frac{d \phi}{ds} \right\rvert.

% So the curvature of a curve in 2-space is also a measure of how the angle between the tangent vectors and the positive $x$-axis is changing as we move along the curve.


\begin{summary}
\item The integration process shows that the length $L$ of a smooth curve defined by $\vr(t)$ on an interval $[a,b]$ is
\[L = \int_a^b |\vr'(t)| \, dt.\]
\item Arc length is useful as a parameter because when we parameterize with respect to arc length, we eliminate the role of speed in our calculation of curvature and the result is a measure that depends only on the geometry of the curve and not on the parameterization of the curve.
\item We define the curvature $\kappa$ of a curve in 2- or 3-space to be the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length, or
    \[\kappa = \left\lvert \frac{d\vT}{ds} \right\rvert.\]

%Show that the curvature of a curve with parameterization $\vr(t)$ in $R^3$ can be found by
%\[\kappa = \frac{\lvert \vr'(t) \times \vr''(t) \rvert}{\lvert \vr'(t) \rvert^3}.\]


%Note that if $\vr(s)$ defines a curve as a function of arc length $s$, then equation (\ref{eq:arc_length_prime}) shows that
%\[\frac{d\vr}{ds} = \frac{d \vr}{dt} \frac{dt}{ds} = \frac{d \vr/dt}{ds/dt} = \frac{\vr'(t)}{|\vr'(t)|} = \vT(t),\]
%so $\frac{d\vr}{ds}$ is the unit tangent vector.
