\begin{pa} \label{PA:11.5} The rectangular coordinate system allows us to draw pictures of graphs over a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system is an alternate coordinate system that allows us to define and draw a different variety of functions. Polar coordinates also provide a convenient and useful way to represent complex numbers. Our application of polar coordinates will be to evaluate some double integrals that cannot be easily evaluated in rectangular coordinates.

The coordinates of a point determine the location of the point. The rectangular coordinates of a point $P$ are given in an ordered pair $(x,y)$, where $x$ is the (signed) distance from the $y$-axis to $P$ and $y$ is the (signed) distance from the $x$-axis to $P$. In this section we will look at another set of coordinates for a point in the plane, the polar coordinates.

    \item Determine the rectangular coordinates of the following points:
        \begin{enumerate}[i.]
        \item The point that is a distance 1 from the origin along the positive $x$-axis.



\begin{comment}

This point has $y$ coordinate 0, so the $x$ coordinate must be 1 and the point is $(1,0)$.



\end{comment}

        \item The point that is a distance 2 from the origin and makes an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ with the positive $x$-axis.



\begin{comment}

The angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ with the positive $x$-axis places the point on the $y$-axis. The point on the $y$-axis a distance 2 from the origin is the point $(0,2)$.



\end{comment}

        \item The point that is a distance 3 from the origin and makes an angle of $\frac{2\pi}{3}$ with the positive $x$-axis.

We can use some right triangle trigonometry here, with a triangle as shown in Figure \ref{F:11.5.Polar_PA}, with a reference angle of $\frac{\pi}{3}$. So $x = 3\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{3}{2}$ and $y = 3\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$. So this point has rectangular coordinates $\left(-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}{2}\right)$.

        \end{enumerate}

    \item Part (a) indicates that the two pieces of information, the distance $r$ from a point to the origin along with the angle $\theta$ that the line through the origin and the point makes with the positive $x$-axis, completely determine the location of the point. The point $(r, \theta)$ is the polar coordinate representation for a point. Find polar coordinates for the points with the given rectangular coordinates.
        \begin{enumerate}[i.]
        \item $(0,-1)$



\begin{comment}

The distance from the point with rectangular coordinates $(0,-1)$ to the origin is 1, and the angle the line through the origin and this point makes with the positive $x$-axis is $\frac{\pi}{2}$, so the polar coordinate representation of this point is $\left(1,\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$.



\end{comment}

        \item $(-2,0)$



\begin{comment}

The distance from the point with rectangular coordinates $(-2,0)$ to the origin is 2, and the angle the line through the origin and this point makes with the positive $x$-axis is $\pi$, so the polar coordinate representation of this point is $(2,\pi)$.



\end{comment}

        \item $(-1,1)$



\begin{comment}

The distance from the point with rectangular coordinates $(-1,1)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{2}$, and the angle the line through the origin and this point makes with the positive $x$-axis is $\frac{3\pi}{4}$, so the polar coordinate representation of this point is $\left(\sqrt{2},\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)$.
