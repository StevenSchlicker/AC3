\begin{pa} \label{PA:2.1} In this section we study limits of functions of several variables, with a focus on limits of functions of two variables.

    \item Review the definition of the limit of a function $f$ of a single variable $x$ from first semester calculus and correctly complete the following sentence.


\begin{quote} A function $f = f(x)$ has a limit at the point where $x=a$ if ... .
\end{quote}


\begin{comment}

In single variable calculus we stated that a function $f$ of the single variable $x$ has a limit $L$ at the point where $x = a$ if we can make all of the values of $f(x)$ as close as we want to $L$ by choosing $x$ as close to $a$ (but not equal to $a$) as we need.

    \item Now let $f$ be the function of the variables $x$ and $y$ defined by $f(x,y) = \frac{x^2+y^2}{x+y}$.
        \begin{enumerate}[i.]
        \item Let $y$ be held constant at $y=1$. Write a formula for $f$ then as a function of $x$ alone on this trace. Does this single variable function $f$ have a limit at $x=2$? If yes, explain why and find the limit. If no, explain why not.

\begin{comment}

If we hold $y$ constant at $y=1$, then $f(x,1)$ is a function of $x$ alone. More specifically,
\[f(x,1) = \frac{x^2+1}{x+1}.\]
Since $f(x,1)$ is a quotient of continuous functions and the denominator is defined at $x=2$, we have
\[\lim_{x \to 2} f(x,1) = \frac{2^1+1}{2+1} = \frac{5}{3}.\]

        \item Now let $y$ vary and hold $x$ constant at $x=0$. Write a formula for $f$ then as a function of $y$ alone on this trace. Does this single variable function $f$ have a limit at $y=0$? If yes, explain why and find the limit. If no, explain why not.

\begin{comment}

If we hold $x$ constant at $x=0$, then $f(0,y)$ is a function of $y$ alone. More specifically,
\[f(0,y) = \frac{y^2}{y}.\]
Since we don't let $y$ actually equal 0 in the limit, we have
\[\lim_{y \to 0} f(0,y) = \lim_{y \to 0} \frac{y^2}{y} = \lim_{y \to 0} y = 0.\]

        \end{enumerate}
        
    \item Now let $f$ be any function of two variables $x$ and $y$. Use the idea of limit as reviewed in part (a) to complete the following statement of what it means for $f = f(x,y)$ to have a limit $L$ at a point $(x, y) = (a, b)$.

\begin{quote} A function $f$ of the two variables $x$ and $y$ has a limit $L$ at the point where $(x, y) = (a, b)$ if $\ldots$
\end{quote}

\begin{comment}

A function $f = f(x,y)$ of the independent variables $x$ and $y$ has a limit $L$ at the point where $(x,y) = (a,b)$ if we can make all of the values of $f(x,y)$ as close as we want to $L$ by choosing $(x,y)$ as close to $(a,b)$ (but not equal to $(a,b)$) as we need.
