\begin{activity} \label{A:2.3.3} Let $f = f(x,y)$ be a function of the independent variables $x$ and $y$.

	\item Run the animation in Figure \ref{F:PD_xy}. Explain as best you can what the second order mixed partial derivative
\[\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\]
tells us about the graph of $f$ by first considering what the first order partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ represents, then
describing what happens to this first order partial derivative as we increase $y$.
