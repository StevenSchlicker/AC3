    \item Consider the set of points $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy the equation $y=-1$. Describe this set as best you can.


    \item Consider the set of points $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy the equation $z=0$. Describe this set as best you can.

\item If we let only $y$ and $z$ vary, the result will be a plane. If $x$ is fixed at $2$, the resulting plane will be parallel to the $yz$-plane and a distance 2 in front of the $yz$-plane (in the positive $x$-direction).   
\item If we let only $x$ and $z$ vary, the result will be a plane. If $y$ is fixed at $-1$, the resulting plane will be parallel to the $xz$-plane and a distance 1 to the left of the $xz$-plane (in the negative $y$-direction). 
\item If we let only $x$ and $y$ vary, the result will be a plane. If $z$ is fixed at $0$, the resulting plane will be just the $xy$-plane.
