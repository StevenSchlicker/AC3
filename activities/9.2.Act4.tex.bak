Let  $\vv = \langle -1, 4 \rangle$.

    \item Would it seem reasonable to you to define the scalar multiple $\frac{1}{2}\vv$? If yes, how do you think this scalar multiple should be defined? If no, explain why.


    \item In general, how do you think a scalar multiple of a vector $\va = \langle a_1, a_2 \rangle$ in $\R^2$ by a scalar $c$ should be defined? Write a formal definition of a scalar multiple of a vector based on your intuition.


    \item In general, how do you think a scalar multiple of a vector $\va = \langle a_1, a_2, a_3 \rangle$ in $\R^3$ by a scalar $c$ should be defined? Write a formal definition of a scalar multiple of a vector based on your intuition.
