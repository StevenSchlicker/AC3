\begin{activity} \label{A:11.7.7} Set up an iterated integral or integrals that will find the average sum of the numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$ if $y$ is between 0 and 2, $x$ is greater than or equal to 0 but cannot exceed $2y$, and $z$ is greater than or equal to 0 but cannot exceed $x+y$.

\begin{activitySolution}
We want the average value of the sum $x+y+z$ over the region described. This average value is given by 
\[\frac{\int_0^2 \int_0^{2y} \int_0^{x+y} x+y+z \, dz \, dx \, dy}{\int_0^2 \int_0^{2y} \int_0^{x+y} 1 \, dz \, dx \, dy}.\]
