\begin{activity} \label{A:9.7.8} Figure \ref{F:9.7.space.curve} shows
  the curve described by 
  the vector-valued function
  $$\vr(t) = \left\langle 2t-\frac12 t^2 + 1,
        t-1\right\rangle.$$

\item Find the object's velocity $\vv(t)$.

\item Find the object's acceleration $\va(t)$.

\item Indicate on Figure \ref{F:9.7.space.curve} the object's
  position, velocity and acceleration at the times $t=0, 2, 4$.  Draw
  the velocity and acceleration vectors with their tails placed at the
  object's position.

\item Find the object's speed and graph it as a function of time $t$.
  When is the object's speed the slowest?  When is the speed
  increasing?  When it is decreasing?

\item What is the relationship between $\vv$ and $\va$ when the speed
  is at a minimum?  What is the relationship between $\vv$ and $\va$
  when the speed is increasing?  when the speed is decreasing?

\item Recall that the speed is $|\vv| = \sqrt{\vv\cdot\vv}$.  Since
  the square root is an increasing function, we see that the speed
  increases precisely when $\vv\cdot\vv$ is increasing.  Use the
  product rule for the dot product to express
  $\frac{d}{dt}(\vv\cdot\vv)$ in terms of the velocity $\vv$ and
  acceleration $\va$.  Use this to explain your observation from the
  last part of this activity:  why is the speed increasing
  when $\vv\cdot\va > 0$?  why is the speed decreasing when
  $\vv\cdot\va < 0$?

\item Show that the speed's rate of change is
  $$
  \frac{d}{dt}|\vv(t)| = \comp_{\va} \vv.
  $$

    \item The quantity $\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)$ is a vector quantity, the vector from the terminal point of $\vr(t)$ to the terminal point of $\vr(t+h)$.

    \item The quantity $\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}$ is a vector quantity, it is a vector in the direction of $\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)$ that is $\frac{1}{h}$ times as long. 

    \item The vector $\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)$ represents a change in position of the object on the time interval $[t, t+h]$. When we multiply by $\frac{1}{h}$, we can consider this vector  $\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}$ as an average change of position, or the average velocity vector of the object on the interval $[t,t+h]$. 

    \item As $h \to 0$, the average velocity vectors $\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}$ approach the instantaneous velocity vector. The average velocity vector $\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}$ is a direction vector for the secant line to the curve that passes through the terminal points of $\vr(t)$ and $\vr(t+h)$. As we let $h \to 0$, these direction vectors approach a direction vector  
        \[\ds \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}\]
of the tangent line to the curve at the terminal point of $\vr(t)$.
