    \item In terms of the components, how can we tell if two vectors $\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle$ and $\vv = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle$ in $\R^2$ are equal? Explain your reasoning.

\item For two vectors to be equal, the vectors should have the same direction and magnitude. For vectors $\vu = \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle$ and $\vv = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle$ in $\R^2$ this will happen when $u_1=v_1$ and $u_2=v_2$.
