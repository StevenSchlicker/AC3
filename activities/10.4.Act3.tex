\begin{activity} \label{A:10.4.3} Is the function $f$ defined by $f(x,y) = \frac{x^2}{y^2+1}$ locally linear at $(0,0)$? Explain.

\begin{activitySolution}
The first order partial derivatives of $f$ are 
\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{2x}{y^2+1} \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{2x^2y}{(y^2+1)^2}.\]
Since these two partial derivatives are continuous everywhere, we know that $f$ is locally linear at $(0,0)$.
