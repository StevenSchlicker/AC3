\begin{activity} \label{A:9.6.4} Consider the paraboloid defined by $f(x,y) = x^2+y^2$.
    \ba
    \item Find a parameterization for the $x=2$ trace of $f$. What type of curve does this trace describe? 

    \item Find a parameterization for the $y=-1$ trace of $f$. What type of curve does this trace describe?

    \item Find a parameterization for the level curve $f(x,y) = 25$. What type of curve does this trace describe?

    \item How do your responses change to all three of the preceding question if you instead consider the function $g$ defined by $g(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$? (Hint for generating one of the parameterizations: $\sec^2(t)-\tan^2(t) = 1$.)

    \item When $x=2$ we have the curve $z = 4+y^2$. A parameterization for this curve is $\vr(t) = \langle 2, t, 4+t^2 \rangle$. This is a parabola in the plane parallel to the $yz$-plane at $x=2$ that opens in the positive $z$-direction, with vertex at $(2,0,4)$. 
    \item When $y=-1$ we have the curve $z = x^2+1$. A parameterization for this curve is $\vr(t) = \langle t, -1, t^2+1 \rangle$. This is a parabola in the plane parallel to the $xz$-plane at $y=-1$ that opens in the positive $z$-direction, with vertex at $(0,-1,1)$. 
    \item When $z=25$ we have the curve $25 = x^2+y^2$. A parameterization for this curve is $\vr(t) = \langle 5\cos(t), 5\sin(t), 25 \rangle$. This is a circle of radius 5 in the plane parallel to the $xy$-plane at $z=25$ with center at the point $(0,0,25)$. 
    \item For the function $g$, the $x=2$ trace has parameterization $\vr(t) = \langle 2, t, 4-t^2 \rangle$, which is a parabola in the plane parallel to the $yz$-plane at $x=2$ that opens in the negative $z$-direction, with vertex at $(2,0,4)$.  The $y=-1$ trace has parameterization $\vr(t) = \langle t, -1, t^2-1 \rangle$, which is a parabola in the plane parallel to the $xz$-plane at $y=-1$ that opens in the positive $z$-direction, with vertex at $(0,-1,-1)$. The level curve at $z=25$ has parameterization for this curve is $\vr(t) = \langle 5\sec(t), 5\tan(t), 25 \rangle$. This is a hyperbola in the plane parallel to the $xy$-plane at $z=25$.
