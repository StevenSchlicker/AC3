\begin{activity} \label{A:2.2.7} Often we are certain graphical information about a function instead of a rule. We can use that information to approximate partial derivatives. For example, suppose that we are given a contour plot of the kinetic energy function (as in Figure \ref{F:pd_contour}) instead of a formula. Use this contour plot to approximate $f_x(4,5)$ and $f_y(4,5)$ as best you can. Compare to your calculations from Activities \ref{A:2,2,5} and \ref{A:2.2.6}.
