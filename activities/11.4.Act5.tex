\begin{activity} \label{A:11.4.5} Let $D$ be a half-disk lamina of radius 3 in quadrants IV and I, centered at the origin as in Activity \ref{A:11.4.3}.  Assume the density at point $(x,y)$ is equal to $x$. Before doing any calculations, what do you expect the $y$-coordinate of the center of mass to be? Why? Now find the center of mass of the lamina. Use appropriate technology to evaluate the integrals.

We calculated that mass of the lamina to be 18 in Activity \ref{A:11.4.3}. So the $x$-coordinate $\overline{x}$ of the center of mass of the lamina is given by 
\[\overline{x} = \frac{1}{18} \int_{-3}^{3} \int_{0}^{\sqrt{9-y^2}} x^2 \, dx \, dy.\]
Wolfram$|$Alpha gives this value as $\frac{9}{16} \pi$. 

Similarly, the $y$-coordinate $\overline{y}$ of the center of mass of the lamina is given by  
\[\overline{y} = \frac{1}{18} \int_{-3}^{3} \int_{0}^{\sqrt{9-y^2}} xy \, dx \, dy.\]
Wolfram$|$Alpha gives this value as $0$, which we should suspect due to the symmetry of the lamina around the $x$-axis.
