\begin{activity} \label{A:10.5.3} The voltage $V$ (in volts) across a circuit is given by Ohm's Law: $V = IR$, where $I$ is the current (in amps) in the circuit and $R$ is the resistance (in ohms). Suppose we connect two resistors with resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$ in parallel as shown in Figure \ref{F:10.5.CR_Circuit}. The total resistance $R$ in the circuit is given by
\[R = \frac{R_1+R_2}{R_1R_2}.\]

    \item Assume that the current and the resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$ are changing over time, $t$. Use the Chain Rule to write a formula for $\frac{dV}{dt}$.



    \item Suppose that, at some particular point in time, we measure the current to be 3 amps and that the current is increasing at $\frac{1}{10}$ amps per second, while resistance $R_1$ is 2 ohms and decreasing at the rate of 0.2 ohms per second and $R_2$ is 1 ohm and increasing at the rate of $0.5$ ohms per second. At what rate is the voltage changing at this point in time?
