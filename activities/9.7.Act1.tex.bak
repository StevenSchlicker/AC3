\begin{activity} \label{A:9.7.1} Let's examine how we can interpret the derivative $\vr'(t)$. Let $\vr$ be the vector-valued function whose graph is shown in Figure \ref{F:VVF_tan_vector}, and let $h$ be a scalar. The vector $\vr(t)$ is the blue vector in Figure \ref{F:9.7.VVF_tan_vector} and $\vr(t+h)$ is the green vector.

    \item What kind of an object is $\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)$? A vector or a scalar? What does this object look like in Figure \ref{F:9.7.VVF_tan_vector}?



    \item What kind of an object is $\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}$? A vector or a scalar? Identify what this object might be in Figure \ref{F:VVF_tan_vector}.



    \item What words would you use to describe the vector $\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}$? (Think about how we described the difference quotient $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ for a function of a single variable, and remember that there is no concept of slope in three dimensions.)



    \item Figure \ref{F:9.7.VVF_tan_vector_animation} presents an animation of the vectors $\frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}$ as we let $h \to 0$. Run this animation and describe what you see. What words would you use to describe the vector
        \[\ds \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\vr(t+h)-\vr(t)}{h}?\]
         (Think about how we described the limit of the difference quotient $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ for a function of a single variable, and remember that there is no concept of slope in three dimensions.)
