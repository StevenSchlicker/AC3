\begin{activity} \label{A:10.6.14} 
  Suppose that the temperature in a region of space is described by
  $$
  T(x,y,z) = 100e^{-x^2-y^2-z^2}
  $$
  and that you are standing at the point $(1,2,-1)$.
  \ba
\item Find the rate of change of the temperature in the direction of
  $\vv=\langle 0, 1, 2\rangle$.  Remember that you should first find a
  {\em unit} vector in the direction of $\vv$.

\item In what direction would you move to cause the temperature to
  decrease as quickly as possible?

\item How fast does the temperature decrease in this direction?

\item Find a direction in which the temperature does
  not change.
