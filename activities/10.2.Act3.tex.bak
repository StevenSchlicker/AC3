\begin{activity} \label{A:10.2.3} Let $f(x,y) = \sin(x)e^{-y}$. A graph of $f$ on the domain $[0,\pi] \times [-2,0]$ is shown in Figure \ref{F:10.2.PD_x}.
    \ba
	\item The animation in Figure \ref{F:10_2_PD_x} shows the difference quotients
\[\frac{f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)}{h}\]
for different values of $h$. Run the animation in Figure \ref{F:10.2.PD_x}. Pick a frame and identify the point $(a,b,f(a,b))$ and the point $(a+h,b,f(a+h,b))$. Then explain as best you can, and in as much detail as you can, what the difference quotient
represents, geometrically, for some appropriate value of $h$. Your explanation should involve the use of the words ``secant" and slope.



    \item Now explain in as much detail as you can what you think the partial derivative
\[\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)}{h}\]
represents, geometrically, in Figure \ref{F:10.2.PD_x}. (Hint: What do you think the blue segment represents?)
