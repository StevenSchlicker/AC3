  Figure \ref{F:10.6.gradient.field} shows a plot of the gradient
  $\nabla f$ at several points for some function $f(x,y)$.

\item Consider each of the three indicated points, and draw, as best
  as you can, the contour line through that point.

\item Beginning at each point, draw a curve on which $f$ is continually
  decreasing.
