\begin{activity} \label{A:10.8.5} The Cobb-Douglas production
  function\index{Cobb-Douglas production function} is used in
  economics to model production levels based on labor and equipment. A
  Cobb-Douglas function has the form 
  \[f(x,y) = Cx^{\alpha}y^{1-\alpha}\] where $x$ is the dollar amount
  spent on labor, $y$ is the dollar amount spent on
  equipment, and $C$ is a constant of proportionality. Suppose we have
  a specific Cobb-Douglas function of the 
  form
  \[f(x, y) = 50 x^{0.4}y^{0.6}\] 
  and a fixed amount of money, \$1.5 million, to spend on labor and
  equipment.  

  Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to determine how much should
  be spent on labor and how much on equipment to maximize productivity.
