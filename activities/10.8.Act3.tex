\begin{activitySolution}
The value of $\lambda$ tells us about how much our function changes if we increase the value of our constraint by 1 unit. In the context of Activity \ref{A:10.8.1}, if we increase the capacity (volume) of our can to 356 cc of liquid, the surface area of the can of minimal surface area will increase by approximately 0.52 square centimeters.
