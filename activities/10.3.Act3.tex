\begin{activity} \label{A:10.3.3} Let $f = f(x,y)$ be a function of the independent variables $x$ and $y$.

	\item Run the animation in Figure \ref{F:10.3.PD_xy}. Explain as best you can what the second order mixed partial derivative
\[\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\]
tells us about the graph of $f$ by first considering what the first order partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ represents, then
describing what happens to this first order partial derivative as we increase $y$.

\item The second order unmixed partial derivative $f_{xy}$ tells us how the first order partial derivative $f_x$ changes for each unit increase in $y$ while keeping $x$ constant. 

Since the first order partial derivative $f_x$ gives the slope of the tangent lines to the surface in the $x$-direction, the second order mixed partial $f_{xy}$ tells us how the slopes of the tangent lines to the $x$ trace of $f$ are changing as we increase $y$. We can interpret this as telling us the   how the surface is twisting along a trace in the $x$-direction as we increase $y$.
