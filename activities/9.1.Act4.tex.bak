    Let $P=(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and $Q=(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ be two points in $\R^3$. These two points form opposite vertices of a rectangle whose sides are planes parallel to the coordinate planes as illustrated in Figure \ref{F:1.1.Distance_3D}, and the distance between $P$ and $Q$ is the length of the diagonal shown in Figure \ref{F:1.1.Distance_3D}.

    \item Consider the right triangle in the base of the rectangle whose hypotenuse is shown as a dashed line in Figure \ref{F:1.1.Distance_3D}. What are the vertices of this triangle? Since this right triangle lies in a plane, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find a formula for the length of the hypotenuse of this triangle. Find such a formula, which will be in terms of $x_0$, $y_0$, $x_1$, and $y_1$.

    \item Now notice that the triangle whose hypotenuse is the segment connecting the points $P$ and $Q$ with a leg as the hypotenuse of the triangle found in part (a) lies entirely in a plane, so we can again use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of its hypotenuse. Explain why the length of this hypotenuse is
        \begin{equation*} \label{eq:Distance_3D}
        \sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2 + (z_1-z_0)^2}.
        \end{equation*}
        This is the formula for the distance between the points $P$ and $Q$.
