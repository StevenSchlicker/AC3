\begin{activity} \label{A:9.3.1}  Determine the work done by a 25 pound force acting at a $30^{\circ}$ angle to the direction of the object's motion, if the object is pulled 10 feet.  In addition, is more work or less work done if the angle to the direction of the object's motion is $60^\circ$?
\end{activity}
\begin{smallhint}
Use $W = |\vF| \cos(\theta) |\vv|$.
\end{smallhint}
\begin{bighint}
Identify $|\vF|$, $\theta$, and $|\vv|$ in $W = |\vF| \cos(\theta) |\vv|$ from the given information.
\end{bighint}
\begin{activitySolution}
If $\vF$ is our force, then $|\vF| = 25$ pounds. The angle at which the force is acting is $\theta = 30^{\circ}$, and the object is moved 10 feet, so the work done is  
\[|\vF| \cos(\theta) |\vv| = 25 \cos\left(30^{\circ}\right)(10) = 125 \sqrt{3} \text{ lb-ft} \approx 216.5 \text{ lb-ft}.\]
If we increase the angle to $60^{\circ}$, then the work done is
\[|\vF| \cos(\theta) |\vv| = 25 \cos\left(60^{\circ}\right)(10) = 125 \text{ lb-feet}.\]
So the work done if the force is applied at the higher angle is less, but about 91.5 lb-ft. This should be expected -- less of the force is applied to the direction of motion at the higher angle, resulting in less work done.
