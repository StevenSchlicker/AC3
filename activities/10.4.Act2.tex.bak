\begin{activity} \label{A:2.4.2} Let $f$ be the function defined by $f(x,y) = x^{1/3}y^{1/3}$.
    \ba
    \item Determine
    \[\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(0+h,0)-f(0,0)}{h}.\]
    What does this limit tell us about $f_x(0,0)$?



    \item Note that $f(x,y)=f(y,x)$, and this symmetry implies that $f_x(0,0) = f_y(0,0)$. So both partial derivatives of $f$ exist at $(0,0)$. A picture of the surface defined by $f$ near $(0,0)$ is shown in Figure \ref{F:Not_diff}. Based on this picture, do you think $f$ is locally linear at $(0,0)$? Why?

    \item Show that the curve where $x=y$ on the surface defined by $f$ is not differentiable at 0. What does this tell us about the local linearity of $f$ at $(0,0)$?
