\begin{activity} \label{A:11.4.7} Let $x$ denote the time (in minutes) that a person spends waiting in a checkout line at a grocery store and $y$ the time (in minutes) that it takes to check out. Set up a double integral that will determine the probability that you will spend no more than 10 minutes waiting and then checking out at this grocery store if the joint probability density function for $x$ and $y$ is
\[f(x,y) = \frac{1}{8} e^{-x/4-y/2}.\]

\begin{activitySolution}
We need to have $x+y = 10$ with $x$ between 0 and $10$, so a double integral that represents the probability that you will spend no more than 10 minutes waiting and then checking out at this grocery store is
\[\int_0^{10} \int_0^{10-x} f(x,y) \, dy \, dx.\]
