\begin{activity} \label{A:2.3.2} Let $f = f(x,y)$ be a function of the independent variables $x$ and $y$.

	\item Run the animation in Figure \ref{F:PD_xx}. Explain as best you can what the second order unmixed partial derivative Explain as best
you can what the second order mixed partial derivative
\[\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\]
tells us about the graph of $f$ by first considering what the first order partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ represents, then
describing what happens to this first order partial derivative as we increase $x$.
