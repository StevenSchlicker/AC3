\begin{activity} \label{A:2.2.1} If $f = f(x,y)$ is a function of the two independent variables $x$ and $y$ and we hold $x$ constant and allow $y$ to vary, then we can differentiate the resulting function of $y$ to obtain what we call the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$. Complete the following definition:

\begin{quote} The partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$ is
\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y) = f_y(x,y) = ...\]
\end{quote}
