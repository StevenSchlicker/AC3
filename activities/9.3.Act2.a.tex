\begin{activity} \label{A:9.3.2.a}  Determine each of the following.
  \ba
  \item The length of the vector $\vu=\langle 1,2,-3\rangle$ using the
    dot product.  
\item The angle between the vectors $\vu =\langle 1, 2 \rangle$ and
  $\vv = \langle 4, -1 \rangle$ to the nearest tenth of a degree. 

\item The angle between the vectors $\vy =\langle 1, 2, -3 \rangle$
  and $\vz = \langle -2, 1, 1 \rangle$ to the nearest tenth of a
  degree. 

\item If the angle between the vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ is a right
  angle, what does the expression $\vu\cdot\vv=|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta$
  say about their dot product?

\item If the angle between the vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ is acute---that
  is, less than $\pi/2$---what does the
  expression $\vu\cdot\vv=|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta$ say about their dot
  product?

\item If the angle between the vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ is
  obtuse---that is, greater than $\pi/2$---what does the expression
  $\vu\cdot\vv=|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta$ say about their dot product?

	\ba
	\item Since $|\vu| = \sqrt{\vu \cdot \vu}$, we have 
\[|\langle 1,2,-3\rangle| = \sqrt{1^2+2^2+(-3)^2} = \sqrt{14}.\]
	
	\item The angle $\theta$ between $\vu$ and $\vv$ is 
\[\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\vu\cdot\vv}{|\vu||\vv|}\right) = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}\sqrt{17}}\right) \approx 77.5^{\circ}.\]

	\item The angle $\theta$ between $\vy$ and $\vz$ is 
\[\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\vy\cdot\vz}{|\vy||\vz|}\right) = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{\sqrt{14}\sqrt{6}}\right) \approx 109.1^{\circ}.\]

\item If $\theta = 90^{\circ}$, then $\cos(\theta) = 0$ and $\vu \cdot \vv = 0$. 

\item If $\theta$ is acute, then $\cos(\theta) > 0$. Since $|\vu|$ and $|\vv|$ are greater than or equal to 0, it follows that $\vu \cdot \vv \geq 0$.

\item If $\theta$ is obtuse, then $\cos(\theta) < 0$. Since $|\vu|$ and $|\vv|$ are greater than or equal to 0, it follows that $\vu \cdot \vv \leq 0$.
