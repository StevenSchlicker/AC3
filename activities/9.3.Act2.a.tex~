\begin{activity} \label{A:9.3.2}  Determine each of the following.
  \ba
\item The angle between the vectors $\vu =\langle 1, 2 \rangle$ and
  $\vv = \langle 4, -1 \rangle$ to the nearest tenth of a degree. 

\item The angle between the vectors $\vy =\langle 1, 2, -3 \rangle$
  and $\vz = \langle -2, 1, 1 \rangle$ to the nearest tenth of a
  degree. 

\item If the vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ are orthogonal, what does the
  expression $\vu\cdot\vv=|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta$ say about their dot
  product?

\item If the angle between the vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ is acute---that
  is, less than $\pi/2$---what does the
  expression $\vu\cdot\vv=|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta$ say about their dot
  product?

\item If the angle between the vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ is
  obtuse---that is, greater than $\pi/2$---what does the expression
  $\vu\cdot\vv=|\vu||\vv|\cos\theta$ say about their dot product?
