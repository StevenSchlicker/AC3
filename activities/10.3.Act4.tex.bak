\begin{activity} \label{A:10.3.4} Let $f(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}xy^2$ represent the kinetic energy in Joules of an object of mass $x$ in
kilograms with velocity $y$ in meters per second. Let $(a,b)$ be the point $(4,5)$ in the domain of $f$.
	\ba
	\item Calculate $\ds \frac{ \partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}$ at the point $(a,b)$. Then explain as best you can what this second order partial
derivative tells us about kinetic energy. (Hint: Recall that $\ds \frac{ \partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}$ is the first order partial derivative of
$f_x$ with respect to $x$. Compare to the discussion in Activity \ref{act:10.3.ke_x}.)
