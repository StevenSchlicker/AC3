\begin{activity} \label{A:9.4.5}  Suppose 
  $\vu = \langle 2, -1, 0\rangle$ and $\vv = \langle 0, 1, 3\rangle$.
  Use the formula (\ref{E:9.4.cross.def}) to compute the following.

  \ba
  \item Find the cross product $\vu\times\vv$.  

  \item Find the cross product $\vu\times \vi$.

  \item Find the cross product $\vu\times\vu$.

  \item Evaluate the dot products $\vu\cdot(\vu\times\vv)$ and
    $\vv\cdot(\vu\times\vv)$.  What does this tell you about the
    geometric relationship between $\vu$, $\vv$, and $\vu\times\vv$?
  \item We can see that this relationship is generally true.  Given
    $\vu = (u_1,u_2,u_3)$ and $\vv=(v_1,v_2,v_3)$, find the dot
    product $\vu\cdot(\vu\times\vv)$.
  \item Explain why we now know that the cross product $\vu\times\vv$
    is orthogonal to both $\vu$ and $\vv$.  The direction of the cross
    product is determined by the right-hand rule.  Given the vectors
    $\vu$ and $\vv$ shown below in Figure \ref{F:9.4.activity.2},
    sketch the cross products $\vu\times\vv$ and $\vv\times\vu$.
