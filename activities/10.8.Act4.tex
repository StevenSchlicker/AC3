  Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the point on the line 
  $x-2y=5$ that is closest to the point $(1,3)$.
  \ba
  \item Write the function $f(x,y)$ that measures the {\em square} of
    the distance from $(x,y)$ to $(1,3)$.  (The extrema of this
    function are the same as the extrema of the distance function, but
    $f(x,y)$ is simpler to work with.)
  \item What is the constraint $g(x,y) = c$?
  \item Write the equations resulting from $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla
    g$ and the constraint.  Find all the points
    $(x,y)$ satisfying these equations.
  \item Test all the points you found to determine the extrema.
