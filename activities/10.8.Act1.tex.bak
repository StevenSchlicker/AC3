    \item What assumption should we make about the shape of a soda pop can? What are the variables in this problem? What restriction, if any, are there on these variables?



    \item What quantity do we want to optimize in this problem? What equation describes the constraint?




    \item Find $\lambda$ and the values of your variables that satisfy equation (\ref{eq:Lagrange_ex1}) in the context of this problem.



    \item Determine the dimensions of the pop can that give the desired solution to this constrained optimization problem.

Assume the pop can is cylindrical. Let $r$ by the radius and $h$ the height of the can. Since the volume is to be 355cc, we must have $r>0$ and $h>0$. We want to minimize the surface area $A$ of the can, where
\[A(r,h) = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h.\]
The volume of the can is $V(r,h) = \pi r^2 h$, so our constraint is
\[355 = V(r,h) = \pi r^2 h.\]
To solve this constrained optimization problem, we need to find the values of $\lambda$, $r$, and $h$ that satisfy
\begin{align*}
\nabla A &= \lambda \nabla V \\
\left\langle 4\pi r + 2\pi h, 2 \pi r \right\rangle = \lambda \left\langle 2\pi rh, \pi r^2 \right\rangle.
\end{align*}
So we have to solve the equations
\begin{align*}
\pi r^2h &= 355 \\
4\pi r + 2\pi h &= \lambda 2\pi rh \\
2 \pi r &= \lambda \pi r^2.
\end{align*}
Since $r>0$, these equations simplify to
\begin{align*}
2\pi r^2h &= 355 \\
2r + h &= \lambda rh \\
2 &= \lambda r.
\end{align*}
So
\begin{equation} \label{eq:LM_example1}
\lambda = \frac{2}{r} = \frac{2r+h}{rh}.
\end{equation}
Now
\[h = \frac{355}{\pi r^2},\]
so equation (\ref{eq:LM_example1}) becomes
\[\frac{2}{r} = \frac{r+h}{rh} = \frac{2\pi r^3+355}{355r}.\]
Applying some algebra yields
\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{r} &= \frac{2\pi r^3+355}{355r} \\
710 &= 2\pi r^3 + 355 \\
r^3 &= \frac{355}{2\pi} \\
r &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{355}{2\pi}} \\
r &\approx 3.84 \text{ cm}.
\end{align*}
This makes
\[h = \frac{355}{\pi r^2} = \approx 7.66 \text{ cm}\]
and
\[\lambda = \frac{2}{r} \approx 0.52.\]
So to minimize the surface area under the assumptions we have made, the radius should be approximately 3.84 cm and the height approximately 7.66 cm.
