\item Consider the graph of $y = f(x)$ provided in Figure~\ref{F:2.6.Ez4} and use it to answer the following questions.
\ba
	\item Use the provided graph to estimate the value of $f'(1)$.
	\item Sketch an approximate graph of $y = f^{-1}(x)$.  Label at least three distinct points on the graph that correspond to three points on the graph of $f$.
	\item Based on your work in (a), what is the value of $(f^{-1})'(-1)$?  Why?

\item Let $f(x) = \frac{1}{4}x^3 + 4.$
\ba
	\item Sketch a graph of $y = f(x)$ and explain why $f$ is an invertible function.
	\item Let $g$ be the inverse of $f$ and determine a formula for $g$.
	\item Compute $f'(x)$, $g'(x)$, $f'(2)$, and $g'(6)$.  What is the special relationship between $f'(2)$ and $g'(6)$?  Why?
\ea
\item Let $h(x) = x + \sin(x)$.
\ba
	\item Sketch a graph of $y = h(x)$ and explain why $h$ must be invertible.
	\item Explain why it does not appear to be algebraically possible to determine a formula for $h^{-1}$.
	\item Observe that the point $(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} + 1)$ lies on the graph of $y = h(x)$.  Determine the value of $(h^{-1})'(\frac{\pi}{2} + 1)$.
