  \item Find the exact area of each described region.
  	\ba 
		\item The finite region between the curves $x = y(y-2)$ and $x=-(y-1)(y-3)$.
		\item The region between the sine and cosine functions on the interval $[\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{3\pi}{4}]$.
		\item The finite region between $x = y^2 - y - 2$ and $y = 2x-1$.
		\item The finite region between $y = mx$ and $y = x^2-1$, where $m$ is a positive constant.

   \item Let $f(x) = 1-x^2$ and $g(x) = ax^2 - a$, where $a$ is an unknown real number.  For what value(s) of $a$ is the area between the curves $f$ and $g$ equal to 2?
   
    
   \item Let $f(x) = 2-x^2$.  Recall that the average value of any continuous function $f$ on an interval $[a,b]$ is given by $\frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx$.
   	\ba
		\item Find the average value of $f(x) = 2-x^2$ on the interval $[0,\sqrt{2}]$.  Call this value $r$.
		\item Sketch a graph of $y = f(x)$ and $y = r$.  Find their intersection point(s).
		\item Show that on the interval $[0,\sqrt{2}]$, the amount of area that lies below $y = f(x)$ and above $y = r$ is equal to the amount of area that lies below $y = r$ and above $y = f(x)$.
		\item Will the result of (c) be true for any continuous function and its average value on any interval?  Why?
