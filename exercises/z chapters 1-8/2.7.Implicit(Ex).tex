  \item Consider the curve given by the equation $2y^3+y^2-y^5 = x^4 - 2x^3  + x^2$.  Find all points at which the tangent line to the curve is horizontal or vertical.
  \item For the curve given by the equation $\sin(x+y) + \cos(x-y) = 1$, find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point $(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$.
  \item Implicit differentiation enables us a different perspective from which to see why the rule $\frac{d}{dx} [a^x] = a^x \ln(a)$ holds, if we assume that $\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}$.  This exercise leads you through the key steps to do so.
  	\ba
		\item Let $y = a^x$.  Rewrite this equation using the natural logarithm function to write $x$ in terms of $y$ (and the constant $a$).
		\item Differentiate both sides of the equation you found in (a) with respect to $x$, keeping in mind that $y$ is implicitly a function of $x$.
		\item Solve the equation you found in (b) for $\frac{dy}{dx}$, and then use the definition of $y$ to write $\frac{dy}{dx}$ solely in terms of $x$.  What have you found?
