  \item For each of the following integrals involving rational functions, (1) use a CAS to find the partial fraction decomposition of the integrand; (2) evaluate the integral of the resulting function without the assistance of technology; (3) use a CAS to evaluate the original integral to test and compare your result in (2).
  \ba
  	\item $\ds \int \frac{x^3 + x + 1}{x^4 - 1} \, dx$
	\item $\ds \int \frac{x^5 + x^2 + 3}{x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6} \, dx$
	\item $\ds \int \frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x-3)^3} \, dx$

  \item For each of the following integrals involving radical functions, (1) use an appropriate $u$-substitution along with Appendix~\ref{C:9.IntegralTable} to evaluate the integral without the assistance of technology, and (2) use a CAS to evaluate the original integral to test and compare your result in (1).
  \ba
  	\item $\ds \int \frac{1}{x \sqrt{9x^2 + 25}} \, dx$
	\item $\ds \int x \sqrt{1 + x^4} \, dx$
	\item $\ds \int  e^x \sqrt{4 + e^{2x}} \, dx$
	\item $\ds \int \frac{\tan(x)}{\sqrt{9 - \cos^2(x)}}  \, dx$

  \item Consider the indefinite integral given by
   $$\int \frac{\sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}}{x} \, dx.$$
  	\ba
		\item Explain why $u$-substitution does not offer a way to simplify this integral by discussing at least two different options you might try for $u$.
		\item Explain why integration by parts does not seem to be a reasonable way to proceed, either, by considering one option for $u$ and $dv$.
		\item Is there any line in the integral table in Appendix~\ref{C:9.IntegralTable} that is helpful for this integral?
		\item Evaluate the given integral using \emph{WolframAlpha}.  What do you observe?
