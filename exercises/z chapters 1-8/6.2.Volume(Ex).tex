  \item Consider the curve $f(x) = 3 \cos(\frac{x^3}{4})$ and the portion of its graph that lies in the first quadrant between the $y$-axis and the first positive value of $x$ for which $f(x) = 0$.  Let  $R$ denote the region bounded by this portion of $f$, the $x$-axis, and the $y$-axis.  
   \ba
   		\item Determine the arc length of $f$ that lies along the upper boundary of $R$. 	
		\item Determine the area of $R$.
		\item Suppose that the region $R$ is revolved around the $x$-axis.  Find the volume of the solid of revolution that is generated.  
		\item Suppose instead that $R$ is revolved around the $y$-axis.  If possible, set up an integral expression whose value is the exact volume of the solid of revolution and evaluate the integral using appropriate technology.  If not possible, explain why.
