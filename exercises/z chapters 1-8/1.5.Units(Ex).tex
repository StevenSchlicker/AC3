\item A cup of coffee has its temperature $F$ (in degrees Fahrenheit) at time $t$ given by the function $F(t) = 75 + 110 e^{-0.05t}$, where time is measured in minutes.
	\ba
		\item Use a central difference with $h = 0.01$ to estimate the value of $F'(10)$.
		\item What are the units on the value of $F'(10)$ that you computed in (a)?  What is the practical meaning of the value of $F'(10)$?
		\item Which do you expect to be greater: $F'(10)$ or $F'(20)$?  Why?  
		\item Write a sentence that describes the behavior of the function $y = F'(t)$ on the time interval $0 \le t \le 30$.  How do you think its graph will look?  Why?

\item The temperature change $T$ (in Fahrenheit degrees), in a patient, that is generated by a dose $q$ (in milliliters), of a drug, is given by the function $T = f(q)$.
\ba
	\item What does it mean to say $f(50) = 0.75$?  Write a complete sentence to explain, using correct units.
	\item A person's sensitivity, $s$, to the drug is defined by the function $s(q) = f'(q)$.  What are the units of sensitivity?
	\item Suppose that $f'(50) = -0.02$.  Write a complete sentence to explain the meaning of this value.  Include in your response the information given in (a).

\item The velocity of a ball that has been tossed vertically in the air is given by $v(t) = 16 - 32t$, where $v$ is measured in feet per second, and $t$ is measured in seconds.  The ball is in the air from $t = 0$ until $t = 2$.
\ba
	\item When is the ball's velocity greatest?
	\item Determine the value of $v'(1)$.  Justify your thinking.
	\item What are the units on the value of $v'(1)$?  What does this value and the corresponding units tell you about the behavior of the ball at time $t = 1$?  
	\item What is the physical meaning of the function $v'(t)$?

\item The value, $V$, of a particular automobile (in dollars) depends on the number of miles, $m$, the car has been driven, according to the function $V = h(m)$.  
\ba
	\item Suppose that $h(40000) = 15500$ and $h(55000) = 13200$.  What is the average rate of change of $h$ on the interval $[40000,55000]$, and what are the units on this value?
	\item In addition to the information given in (a), say that $h(70000) = 11100$.  Determine the best possible estimate of $h'(55000)$ and write one sentence to explain the meaning of your result, including units on your answer.
	\item Which value do you expect to be greater: $h'(30000)$ or $h'(80000)$?  Why?
	\item Write a sentence to describe the long-term behavior of the function $V = h(m)$, plus another sentence to describe the long-term behavior of $h'(m)$.  Provide your discussion in practical terms regarding the value of the car and the rate at which that value is changing.
