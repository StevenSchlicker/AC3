\item An object moving vertically has its height at time $t$ (measured in feet, with time in seconds) given by the function $h(t) = 3 + \frac{2\cos(t)}{1.2^t}$.
\ba
	\item What is the object's instantaneous velocity when $t =2$?
	\item What is the object's acceleration at the instant $t = 2$?
	\item Describe in everyday language the behavior of the object at the instant $t = 2$.
\ea
\item Let $f(x) = \sin(x) \cot(x)$.
\ba
	\item Use the product rule to find $f'(x)$.
	\item True or false: for all real numbers $x$, $f(x) = \cos(x)$.
	\item Explain why the function that you found in (a) is almost the opposite of the sine function, but not quite.  (Hint: convert all of the trigonometric functions in (a) to sines and cosines, and work to simplify.  Think carefully about the domain of $f$ and the domain of $f'$.)
\ea
\item Let $p(z)$ be given by the rule
$$p(z) = \frac{z\tan(z)}{z^2\sec(z) + 1} + 3 e^z + 1.$$
\ba
	\item Determine $p'(z)$.
	\item Find an equation for the tangent line to $p$ at the point where $z = 0$.
	\item At $t = 0$, is $p$ increasing, decreasing, or neither?  Why?
