\begin{pa} \label{PA:9.7.2} When computers first came out, there was a QBasic game, Gorillas, in which gorillas threw banana grenades at each other attempting to blow each other up.\footnote{A on-line version can be found at \url{http://www.online-games-zone.com/pages/classic/gorillas.php}. No endorsement of this site or the advertisements is implied.} Typically, a player uses trial and error to determine the correct velocity and launch angle to destroy his/her opponent. Play a few rounds of this game and come up with a strategy to win the game.
