\begin{activity} \label{A:9.7.5} In this activity we determine the equation of a plane tangent to the surface defined by $f(x,y) = x^2+y^2$ at the point $(3,4,5)$.
    \ba
    \item Find a parameterization for the $x=3$ trace to $f$. What is a direction vector for the line tangent to this trace at the point $(3,4,5)$?



    \item  Find a parameterization for the $y=4$ trace to $f$. What is a direction vector for the line tangent to this trace at the point $(3,4,5)$?



    \item The direction vectors in parts (a) and (b) form a plane containing the point $(3,4,5)$. What is a normal vector for this plane? Find the equation of this plane. Use appropriate technology to draw the graph of $f$ and the plane you determined on the same set of axes. What do you notice? (This plane is the tangent plane to $f$ at the point $(3,4,5)$. We will discuss tangent planes in more detail in a later section.)
