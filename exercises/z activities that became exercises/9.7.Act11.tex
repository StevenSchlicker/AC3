\begin{activity} \label{A:9.7.11} Suppose our gorilla is perched on a building at a height of 300 feet, and her opponent is at the top of a building 500 feet away at a height of 200 feet. Use $g = 32$ feet per second per second.
    \ba
    \item If our gorilla throws a banana with initial speed of 85 feet per second with a launch angle of $60^{\circ}$ (assuming no buildings are in the way), will the banana hit her opponent?



    \item Is it possible for our gorilla to hit her opponent with the banana if she can provide an initial speed for her banana of 85 feet per second. If yes, at what angle should she release her banana? If no, why not?
